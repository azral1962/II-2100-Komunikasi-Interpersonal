\begin_layout Standard
A movement for adult education is sweeping over the nation today;
 and the most spectacular force in that movement is Dale Carnegie,
 a man who has listened to and criticized more talks by adults than has any other man in captivity.
 According to a recent cartoon by

 Ripley,
 he has criticized 150,000 speeches.
 If that grand total doesn't impress you,
 remember that it means one talk for almost every day that has passed since Columbus discovered America.
 Or,
 to put it in other words,
 if all the men who have spoken before him had used only three minutes and had appeared before him in succession,
 it would have taken a solid year,
 listening day and night,
 to hear them all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dale Carnegie's own career,
 filled with sharp contrasts,
 is a striking example of what a man can accomplish when he is obsessed with an original idea and afire with enthusiasm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Born on a Missouri farm ten miles from a railway,
 he never saw a street car until he was twelve years old;
 yet today,
 at forty-six,
 he is familiar with the far-flung corners of the earth,
 everywhere from Hong Kong to Hammerfest;
 and at one time he approached closer to the North Pole than Admiral

 This chap who was a total failure the first half dozen times that he tried to speak in public,
 later became my personal manager.
 Much of my success has been due to training under Dale Carnegie.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Young Carnegie had to struggle for an education,
 for hard luck was always battering away at the old farm in Northwest Missouri.
 Sick with discouragement,
 the family sold out and bought another farm near the State Teachers' College at Warrensburg,
 Missouri.
 Board and room could be had in town for a dollar a day;
 but young Carnegie couldn't afford it.
 So he stayed on the farm and commuted by horseback three miles to college each day.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 There were six hundred students in State Teachers' College;
 and Dale Carnegie was one of the isolated half dozen who couldn't afford to board in town.
 He soon saw that there were certain groups in college who enjoyed influence and prestige-the football and baseball players and the chaps who won the debating and public speaking contests.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 Realizing that he had no flair for athletics,
 he decided to win one of the speaking contests.
 He spent months preparing his talks.
 He practiced as he sat in the saddle galloping back and forth to college;
 he practiced his speeches as he milked the cows;
 and then he mounted a bale of hay in the barn and with great gusto and gesture,
 he harangued the
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 frightened pigeons about the necessity of halting Japanese immigration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But in spite of all his earnestness and preparation,
 he met with defeat after defeat.
 And then suddenly he began to win,
 not one contest but every speaking contest in college.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other students pleaded with him to train them;
 and they won also.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graduating from college,
 he started selling correspondence courses to the ranchers among the hills of Western Nebraska and Eastern Wyoming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In spite of all his boundless energy and enthusiasm,
 he couldn't make the grade.
 He became so discouraged that he went to his hotel room in Alliance,
 Nebraska,
 in the middle of the day,
 threw himself across the bed and wept with despair.
 He longed to go back to college,
 he longed to retreat from the harsh battle of life;
 but he couldn't.
 So he resolved to go to Omaha and get another job.
 He didn't have the money for a railroad ticket;
 so he traveled on a freight train,
 feeding and watering two car loads of wild horses in return for his passage.
 Landing in South Omaha,
 he got a job selling bacon and soap and lard for Armour and Company.
 His territory was up among the Bad Lands and the cow and Indian country of Western South Dakota.
 He covered his territory by freight train and on stage coach and on horseback and slept in pioneer hotels where the only partition between the rooms was a sheet of muslin.
 He studied books on salesmanship,
 rode bucking bronchos,
 played poker with squaw men,
 and learned how to collect money.
 When an inland storekeeper couldn't pay cash for the bacon and hams he had
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 ordered,
 Dale Carnegie would take a dozen pairs of shoes off his shelf,
 sell the shoes to the railroad men and forward the receipts to Armour & Company.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within two years he had taken an unproductive territory that stood in the twenty-fifth place and boosted it to first place among all the twenty-nine car routes leading out of South Omaha.
 Armour and Company offered to promote him,
 saying:

 But he refused the promotion and resigned-resigned,
 went to New York,
 studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts,
 and toured the country playing the role of Doctor Hartley in

He would never be a Booth or a Barrymore.
 He had the good sense to recognize that.
 So back he went to sales work again,
 dispensing automobile trucks for the Packard Company.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He knew nothing about machinery and cared nothing about it.
 Dreadfully unhappy,
 he had to scourge himself to his task each day.
 He longed to have time to study,
 to write the books he had dreamed about writing back in college.
 So he resigned.
 He was going to spend his days writing stories and novels and support himself by teaching in a night school.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Teaching what?
 As he looked back and evaluated his college work,
 he saw that his training in Public Speaking had done more to give him confidence,
 courage,
 poise,
 and the ability to meet and deal with people in business,
 than had all the rest of his college courses put together.
 So he urged the Y.M.C.A.
 schools in New York to give him a chance to conduct courses in public speaking for business men.
\end_layout

 surd.
 They knew.
 They had tried such coursesand they had always failed.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 When they refused to pay him a salary of two dollars a night,
 he agreed to teach on a commission basis and take a percentage of the net profits-if there were any profits to take.
 And inside of three years,
 they were paying him thirty dollars a night on that basis-instead of two.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 The course grew.
 Other Y's heard of it,
 then other cities.
 Dale Carnegie soon became a glorified circuit-rider covering New York,
 Philadelphia,
 Baltimore,
 and later London and Paris.
 All the textbooks were too academic and impractical for the huskies who flocked to his courses.
 Nothing daunted,
 he sat down and wrote one entitled 
\begin_inset ERT

Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business.

 It is now the official text of all the Y.M.C.A.'s as well as the American Bankers' Association and the National Credit Men's Association.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Today far more adults come to Dale Carnegie each session for training in public speaking than go to all the extension courses in public speaking conducted by both Columbia and New York Universities.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 Dale Carnegie claims that any man can talk when he gets mad.
 He says that if you hit the most ignorant man in town on the jaw and knock him down,
 he will get on his feet and talk with a heat,
 emphasis and eloquence that would have rivaled William Jennings Bryan in his palmiest days.
 He claims that almost any man can speak acceptably in public if he has self-confidence and an idea that is stewing and boiling within him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The way to develop self-confidence,
 he says,
 is to
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 do the thing you fear to do and get a record of successful experiences behind you.
 So he forces each man to talk at every session of the course.
 The audience is sympathetic.
 They are all in the same boat;
 and by constant practice,
 they develop a courage,
 confidence,
 and enthusiasm that carries over into their private speaking.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 Dale Carnegie will tell you that he has made a living all these years,
 not by teaching public speaking -that has been incidental.
 He claims his main job has been to help men conquer their fears and develop courage.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 He started out at first to conduct merely a course in public speaking;
 but the students who came were business men.
 Many of them hadn't seen the inside of a class room in thirty years.
 Most of them were paying their tuition on the installment plan.
 They wanted results;
 and they wanted them quick-results that they could use the next day in business interviews and in speaking before groups.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 So he was forced to be swift and practical.
 Consequently,
 he has developed a system of training that is unique-a striking combination of Public Speaking,
 Salesmanship,
 Human Relationship,
 Personality Development and Applied Psychology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor William James of Harvard used to say that the average man develops only ten per cent of his latent mental ability.
 Dale Carnegie,
 by inspiring adults to blast out and smelt some of their hidden ores,
 has created one of the most significant movements in adult education.

DEVELOPING COURAGE AND SELFCONFIDENCE

\begin_layout Standard
More than eighteen thousand business men,
 since 1912,
 have been members of the various public speaking courses conducted by the author.
 Most of them have,
 at his request,
 written stating why they had enrolled for this training and what they hoped to obtain from it.
 Naturally,
 the phraseology varied;
 but the central desire in these letters,
 the basic want in the vast majority,
 remained surprisingly the same:

I become so self-conscious,
 so frightened,
 that I can't think clearly,
 can't concentrate,
 can't remember what I had intended to say.
 I want to gain selfconfidence,
 poise,

 I want to get my thoughts together in logical order and I want to be able to say my say clearly and convincingly before a business group or audience.

 Thousands of their confessions sounded about like that.
 To cite a concrete case:
 Years ago,
 a gentleman here called Mr.
 D.
 W.
 Ghent,
 joined my public speaking course in Philadelphia.
 Shortly after the opening session,
 he invited me to lunch with him in the Manufacturers' Club.
 He was a
\begin_inset Newline newline

 man of middle age and had always led an active life;
 was head of his own manufacturing establishment,
 a leader in church work and civic activities.
 While we were having lunch that day,
 he leaned across the table and said:

 But I am chairman now of a board of college trustees.
 I must preside at their meetings.
 I simply have to do some talking.

After he had completed his training,
 we lost touch with each other for a while.
 In 1921,
 we met and lunched together again at the Manufacturers' Club.
 We sat in the same corner and occupied the same table that we had had on the first occasion.
 Re.
 minding him of our former conversation,
 I asked him if I had been too sanguine then.
 He took a little red-backed note book out of his pocket and showed me a list of talks and dates for which he was booked.

The International Conference for the Limitation of Armaments had been held in Washington shortly before that.
 When it was known that Lloyd George was planning to attend it,
 the Baptists of Philadelphia cabled,
 inviting him to speak at a great mass meeting to be held in their city.
 Lloyd George cabled back that,
 if he came to Washington,
 he would accept their invitation.
 And Mr.
 Ghent informed me that he himself had been chosen,
 from among all the Baptists of that city,
 to introduce England's premier to the audience.

And this was the man who had sat at that same table less than three years before and solemnly asked me if I thought he would ever be able to talk in public!

\begin_layout Standard
Was the rapidity with which he forged ahead in his speaking ability unusual?
 Not at all.
 There have been hundreds of similar cases.
 For example-to quote one more specific instance-years ago,
 a Brooklyn physician,
 whom we will call Dr.
 Curtis,
 spent the winter in Florida near the training grounds of the Giants.
 Being an enthusiastic baseball fan,
 he often went to see them practise.
 In time,
 he became quite friendly with the team,
 and was invited to attend a banquet given in their honor.

Was he prepared?
 Of course.
 He had had the best preparation in the world:
 he had been studying hygiene and practising medicine for almost a third of a century.
 He could have sat in his chair and talked about this subject all night to the man seated on his right or left.
 But to get up and say the same things to even a small audience-that was another matter.
 That was a paralyzing matter.
 His heart doubled its pace and skipped beats at the very contemplation of it.
 He had never made a public speech in his life,
 and every thought that he had had now took wings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What was he to do?
 The audience was applauding.
 Every one was looking at him.
 He shook his head.
 But that served only to heighten the applause,
 to increase the demand.
 The cries of

 He was in positive misery.
 He knew that if he got up he would fail,
 that he would be unable to utter half a dozen sentences.
 So he arose,
 and,
 without saying a word,
 turned his back on his friends and walked silently out of the room,
 a deeply embarrassed and humiliated man.

Small wonder that one of the first things he did after getting back to Brooklyn was to come to the Central Y.

 structor:
 he was in dead earnest.
 He wanted to be

 He prepared his talks thoroughly,
 he practised them with a will,

He did precisely what such a student always does:
 he progressed at a rate that surprised him,
 that surpassed his fondest hopes.
 After the first few sessions his nervousness subsided,
 his confidence mounted higher and higher.

 He was soon accepting invitations to speak elsewhere;
 he now loved the feel and exhilaration of it,
 the distinction and the additional friends it brought him.

 it is the result of a lack of confidence.

And what causes that?
 It is the result of not knowing what you can really do.
 And not knowing what you can do is caused by a lack of experience.
 When you get a record of successful experience behind you,
 your fears will vanish;
 they will melt like night mists under the glare of a July sun.

SUMMARY
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I.
 A few thousand students of this course have written the author stating why they enrolled for this training and what they hoped to obtain from it.
 The prime reason that almost all of them gave was this:
 they wanted to conquer their nervousness,
 to be able to think on their feet,
 and to speak with self-confidence and ease before a group of any size.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 2.
 The ability to do this is not difficult to acquire.
 It is not a gift bestowed by Providence on only a few rarely endowed individuals.
 It is like the ability to play golf:
 any man-every man-can develop his own latent capacity if he has sufficient desire to do so.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 3.
 Many experienced speakers can think better and talk better when facing a group than they can in conversation with an individual.
 The presence of the larger number proves to be a stimulus,
 an inspiration.
 If you faithfully follow this course,
 the time may come when that will be your experience,
 too;
 and you will look forward with positive pleasure to making an address.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 4.
 Do not imagine that your case is unusual.
 Many men who afterwards became famous speakers were,
 at the outset of their careers,
 beset with selfconsciousness and almost paralyzed with audience fright.
 This was the experience of Bryan,
 Jean Jaurès,
 Lloyd George,
 Charles Stewart Parnell,
 John Bright,
 Disraeli,
 Sheridan and a host of others.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 5.
 No matter how often you speak,
 you may always experience this self-consciousness just before you begin;
 but,
 in a few seconds after you have gotten on your feet,
 it will vanish completely.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 6.
 In order to get the most out of this course and to get it with rapidity and dispatch,
 do these four things:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 a.
 Start this course with a strong and persistent desire.
 Enumerate the benefits this training will bring you.
 Arouse your enthusiasm for it.
 Think what it can mean to you financially,
 socially and in terms of increased influence and leadership.
 Remember that upon the depth of your desire will depend the swiftness of your progress.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 b.
 Prepare.
 You can't feel confident unless you know what you are going to say.

 Roosevelt confessed that he conquered his fear of grizzly bears,
 mean horses and gun-fighters by that method.
 You can conquer your fear of audiences by taking advantage of this psychological fact.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 d.
 Practise.
 This is the most important point of all.
 Fear is the result of a lack of confidence;
 and a lack of confidence is the result of not knowing what you can do;
 and that is caused by a lack of experience.
 So get a record of successful experience behind you,
 and your fears will vanish.

\begin_layout Standard
Many speakers do not use shall and will with correctness and discrimination.
 Remember that shall and will always convey either something that will come to pass naturally,
 or something that the speaker is determined to bring to pass by the power of his own effort.
 If you mean to state that a thing will come to pass in the natural order of events,
 use shall when referring to yourself,
 and will when referring to all other subjects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To express determination on your part to bring things about,
 you simply reverse this rule.
 You use will when speaking of yourself and shall when speaking of all other subjects.
 To illustrate:
\end_layout

The famous Italian masters of singing have always taught that it is diaphragmatic breathing.
 And what is that?
 Something strange and new and arduous?
 Not at all.
 It shouldn't be.
 You did it perfectly as a baby.
 You practise it now during a part of every twenty-four hours.
 When you lie on the flat of your back to-night in bed,
 you will breathe freely,
 naturally,
 correctly-you will use diaphragmatic breathing.
 For some strange reason,
 it is difficult to breathe any other way except correctly when you are lying in that position.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your problem,
 therefore,
 is simply this:
 To use the same breathing methods when you are standing up as you employ when you are on the flat of your back.
 That does not sound so difficult,
 does it?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your first exercise then is this:
 Lie on the flat of your back and breathe deeply.
 Note that the main activity of the process centers in the middle of the body.
 When you breathe deeply in this position,
 you do not raise your shoulders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is what is happening:
 your spongy,
 porous lungs are being filled and extended with air like a toy balloon.
 The balloon must expand-but how,
 where?
 It is encased at the top and on the sides by a bony box made by the ribs,
 spine and breast bone.
 To be sure the ribs will give somewhat,
 but the easiest way for the lungs to expand is by pushing downwards upon a soft muscle that forms the floor of the chest and the roof of the abdomen.
 This
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 muscle,
 the diaphragm,
 divides your body into two distinct compartments.
 The upper part,
 the chest,
 contains your heart and lungs;
 the lower part,
 the abdomen,
 houses the stomach,
 liver,
 intestines and other vital organs.
 This huge muscle is arched like a roof,
 like a dome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose you were to take one of the paper plates or dishes that one purchases,
 at the ten cent store,
 for picnics.
 Turn it upside down and press on the arched surface-and what happens?
 It flattens and spreads and pushes out on all sides as it flattens.
 That is precisely what your diaphragm does when the lungs,
 filling with air,
 press down against the top of its arch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lie down on the flat of your back now,
 take a deep breath,
 put your fingers right below the breast bone.
 Don't you feel the diaphragm flattening and pushing out?
 Now put your hands at your sides,
 along the lower extremities of your ribs.
 Breathe deeply.
 Don't you feel the balloon-like lungs pushing out the floating ribs?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Practise this diaphragmatic breathing for five minutes the last thing each night in bed,
 and for five minutes the first thing in the morning.
 At night,
 it will tend to soothe and quiet your nerves and make you drowsy.
 In the morning,
 it will brighten and freshen you.
 If this is done faithfully,
 it will not only improve your voice,
 but it will add years to your life.
 Opera singers and vocal teachers are noted for their longevity.
 The famous Manuel Garcia lived to be I0I;
 and he attributed his long life very largely to this daily exercise of deep breathing.

Before a speaker faces his audience,
 he should write a letter to a friend and say:
 'I am to make an address on a subject,
 and I want to make these points.' He should then enumerate the things he is going to speak about in their correct order.
 If he finds that he has nothing to say in his letter,
 he had better write to the committee that invited him and say that the probable death of his grandmother will possibly prevent his being present on the occasion.

SELF-CONFIDENCE THROUGH PREPARATION
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It has been the author's professional duty as well as his pleasure to listen to and criticize approximately six thousand speeches a year each season since 1912.
 These were made,
 not by college students,
 but by mature business and professional men.
 If that experience has engraved on his mind any one thing more deeply than another,
 surely it is this:
 the urgent necessity of preparing a talk before one starts to make it and of having something clear and definite to say,
 something that has impressed one,
 something that won't stay unsaid.
 Aren't you unconsciously drawn to the speaker who,
 you feel,
 has a real message in his head and heart that he zealously desires to communicate to your head and heart?
 That is half the secret of speaking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a speaker is in that kind of mental and emotional state he will discover a significant fact:
 namely,
 that his talk will almost make itself.
 Its yoke will be easy,
 its burden will be light.
 A well prepared speech is already nine-tenths delivered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary reason why most men take this course,

To illustrate:
 some time ago,
 the writer conducted a course in public speaking for the senior officers of New York City banks.
 Naturally,
 the members of such a group,
 having many demands upon their time,
 frequently found it difficult to prepare adequately,
 or to do what they conceived of as preparing.
 All their lives they had been thinking their own individual thoughts,
 nurturing their own personal convictions,
 seeing things from their own distinctive angles,
 living their own original experiences.
 So,
 in that fashion,
 they had spent forty years storing up material for speeches.
 But it was hard for some of them to realize that.
 They could not see the forest for

This group met Friday evenings from five to seven.
 One Friday,
 a certain gentleman connected with an uptown bank-for our purposes here,
 we shall designate him as Mr.
 Jackson-found fourthirty had arrived,
 and,
 what was he to talk about?
 He walked out of his office,
 bought a copy of Forbes' Magazine at a news stand and,
 in the subway coming down to the Federal Reserve Bank where the class met,
 he read an article entitled,
 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

You Have Only Ten Years To Succeed.
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

 He read it,
 not because he was interested in the article especially;
 but because he must speak on something,
 on anything,
 to fill his quota of time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An hour later,
 he stood up and attempted to talk convincingly and interestingly on the contents of this article.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What was the result,
 the inevitable result?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had not digested,
 had not assimilated what he was trying to say.
 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\end_inset

Trying to say
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

that expresses it precisely.
 He was trying.
 There was no real message in him seeking for an outlet;
 and his whole manner and tone revealed it unmistakably.
 How could he expect the audience to be any more impressed than he himself was?
 He kept referring to the article saying the author said so and so.
 There was a surfeit of Forbes' Magazine in it;
 but regrettably little of Mr.
 Jackson.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the writer addressed him somewhat in this fashion:
 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

Mr.
 Jackson,
 we are not interested in this shadowy personality who wrote that article.
 He is not here.
 We can't see him.
 But we are interested in you and your ideas.
 Tell us what you think,
 personally,
 not what somebody else said.
 Put more of Mr.
 Jackson in this.
 Why not take this same subject for next week?
 Why not read this article again,
 and ask yourself whether you agree with the author or not?
 If you do,
 think out his suggestions and illustrate them with observations from your own experience.
 If you don't agree with him,
 say so and tell us why.
 Let this article be merely the starting point from which you launch your own speech.
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

"
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mr.
 Jackson accepted the suggestion,
 reread the article and concluded that he did not agree with the author at all.
 He did not sit down in the subway and try to prepare this next speech to order.
 He let it grow.
 It was a child of his own brain;
 and it developed and expanded and took on stature just as his physical children had done.
 And like his
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 daughters,
 this other child grew day and night when he was least conscious of it.
 One thought was suggested to him while reading some item in the newspaper;
 another illustration swam into his mind unexpectedly when he was discussing the subject with a friend.
 The thing deepened and heightened,
 lengthened and thickened as he thought over it during the odd moments of the week.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next time Mr.
 Jackson spoke on this subject,
 he had something that was his,
 ore that he dug out of his own mine,
 currency coined in his own mint.
 And he spoke all the better because he was disagreeing with the author of the article.
 There is no spur to rouse one like a little opposition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What an incredible contrast between these two speeches by the same man,
 in the same fortnight,
 on the same subject.
 What a colossal difference the right kind of preparation makes!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us cite another illustration of how to do it and how not to do it.
 A gentleman,
 whom we shall call Mr.
 Flynn,
 was a student of this course in Washington,
 D.
 C.
 One afternoon he devoted his talk to eulogizing the capital city of the nation.
 He had hastily and superficially gleaned his facts from a booster booklet issued by the Evening Star.
 They sounded like it-dry,
 disconnected,
 undigested.
 He had not thought over his subject adequately.
 It had not elicited his enthusiasm.
 He did not feel what he was saying deeply enough to make it worth while expressing.
 The whole affair was flat and flavorless and unprofitable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
A SPEECH THAT COULD NOT FAIL
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A fortnight later,
 something happened that touched Mr.
 Flynn to the core:
 a thief stole his Cadillac out of a public garage.
 He rushed to the police and offered rewards,
 but it was all in vain.
 The police admitted that it was well nigh impossible for them to cope with the crime situation;
 yet,
 only a week previously,
 they had found time to walk about the street,
 chalk in hand,
 and fine Mr.
 Flynn because he had parked his car fifteen minutes overtime.
 These

chalk cops,

\end_layout

\end_inset

 who were so busy annoying respectable citizens that they could not catch criminals,
 aroused his ire.
 He was indig.
 nant.
 He had something now to say,
 not something that he had gotten out of a book issued by the Evening Star,
 but something that was leaping hot out of his own life and experience.
 Here was something that was part and parcel of the real mansomething that had aroused his feelings and convictions.
 In his speech eulogizing the city of Washington,
 he had laboriously pulled out sentence by sentence;
 but now he had but to stand on his feet and open his mouth,
 and his condemnation of the police welled up and boiled forth like Vesuvius in action.
 A speech like that is almost foolproof.
 It can hardly fail.
 It was experience plus reflection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
WHAT PREPARATION REALLY IS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Does the preparation of a speech mean the getting together of some faultless phrases written down or memorized?
 No.
 Does it mean the assembling
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 of a few casual thoughts that really convey very little to you personally?
 Not at all.
 It means the assembling of your thoughts,
 your ideas,
 your convictions,
 your urges.
 And you have such thoughts,
 such urges.
 You have them every day of your waking life.
 They even swarm through your dreams.
 Your whole existence has been filled with feelings and experiences.
 These things are lying deep in your subconscious mind as thick as pebbles on the seashore.
 Preparation means thinking,
 brooding,
 recalling,
 selecting the ones that appeal to you most,
 polishing them,
 working them into a pattern,
 a mosaic of your own.
 That doesn't sound like such a difficult program,
 does it?
 It isn't.
 Just requires a little concentration and thinking to a purpose.

When I choose a subject,

 I have many such envelopes.
 If,
 when I am reading,
 I meet a good thing on any subject I am to speak on,
 I slip it into the right envelope,
 and let it lie there.
 I always carry a notebook,
 and if I hear anything in a sermon that will throw light on that subject,
 I put it down,
 and slip it into the envelope.
 Perhaps I let it lie there for a year or more.
 When I want a new sermon,
 I take everything that has been accumulating.
 Between what I find there and the results of my own study,
 I have material enough.
 Then,
 all the time I am going over my sermons,
 taking out a little here,
 adding a little there.
 In that way they never get old.

THE SAGE ADVICE OF DEAN BROWN OF YALE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few years ago the Yale Divinity School celebrated the one hundredth anniversary of its founding.
 On that occasion,
 the Dean,
 Dr.
 Charles Rey- nold Brown,
 delivered a series of lectures on the Art of Preaching.
 These are now published in book form under that name by the Macmillan Company,
 New York.
 Dr.
 Brown has been preparing addresses himself weekly for a third of a century,
 and also training others to prepare and deliver;
 so he was in a position to dispense some sage advice on the subject,
 advice that will hold good regardless of whether the speaker is a man of the cloth preparing a discourse on the Ninety-first Psalm,
 or a shoe manufacturer preparing a speech on Labor Unions.
 So I am taking the liberty of quoting Dr.
 Brown here:

It will be all the better if this process can go on for a long time and not be postponed until Saturday forenoon when you are actually making your final preparation for next Sunday.
 If a minister can hold a certain truth in his mind for a month,
 for six months perhaps,
 for a year it may be,
 before he preaches on it he will find new ideas perpetually sprouting out of it,
 until it shows an abundant growth.
 He may meditate on it as he walks the streets,
 or as he spends some hours on a train,
 when his eyes are too tired to read.

 but it is not a good bed-fellow.
 Yet,
 for all that,

HOW LINCOLN PREPARED HIS SPEECHES
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How did Lincoln prepare his speeches?
 Fortunately,
 we know the facts;
 and,
 as you read here of his method,
 you will observe that Dean Brown,
 in his lecture,
 commended several of the procedures that Lincoln had employed three-quarters of a century previously.
 One of Lincoln's most famous addresses was that in which he declared with prophetic vision:
 
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

"'
\end_layout

\end_inset

A house divided against itself cannot stand.' I believe this government cannot endure,
 permanently,
 half slave and half free.
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

"
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This speech was thought out as he went about his usual work,
 as he ate his meals,
 as he walked the street,
 as he sat in his barn milking his cow,
 as he made his daily trip to the butcher shop and grocery,
 an old gray shawl over his shoulders,
 his market basket over his arm,
 his little son at his side,
 chattering and questioning,
 growing peeved,
 and jerking at the long bony fingers in a vain effort to make his father talk to him.
 But Lincoln stalked on,
 absorbed in his own reflections,
 thinking of his speech,
 apparently unconscious of the boy's existence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From time to time during this brooding and hatching process,
 he jotted down notes,
 fragments,
 sentences here and there on stray envelopes,
 scraps of paper,
 bits torn from paper sacks-anything that was near.
 These he stowed away in the top of his hat and carried them there until he was ready to sit down and arrange them in order,
 and to write and revise the whole thing,
 and to shape it up for delivery and publication.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the joint debates of 1858,
 Senator Douglas delivered the same speech wherever he went;
 but Lincoln kept studying and contemplating and reflecting until he found it easier,
 he said,
 to make a new speech each day than to repeat an old one.
 The subject was forever widening and enlarging in his mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A short time before he moved into the White House,
 he took a copy of the Constitution and three speeches,
 and with only these for reference,
 he locked himself in a dingy,
 dusty back room over a store in Springfield;
 and there,
 away from all intrusion and interruption,
 he wrote out his inaugural address.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How did Lincoln prepare his Gettysburg address?
 Unfortunately,
 false reports have been circulated about it.
 The true story,
 however,
 is fascinating.
 Let us have it:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the commission in charge of the Gettysburg cemetery decided to arrange for a formal dedication,
 they invited Edward Everett to deliver the speech.
 He had been a Boston minister;
 President of Harvard,
 governor of Massachusetts,
 United States senator,
 minister to England,
 secretary of
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 state,
 and was generally considered to be America's most capable speaker.
 The date first set for the dedication ceremonies was October 23,
 1863.
 Mr.
 Everett very wisely declared that it would be impossible for him to prepare adequately on such short notice.
 So the dedication was postponed until November 19,
 nearly a month,
 to give him time to prepare.
 The last three days of that period he spent in Gettysburg,
 going over the battlefield,
 familiarizing himself with all that had taken place there.
 That period of brooding and thinking was most excellent preparation.
 It made the battle real to him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Invitations to be present were despatched to all the members of Congress,
 to the President and his cabinet.
 Most of these declined;
 the committee was surprised when Lincoln agreed to come.
 Should they ask him to speak?
 They had not intended to do so.
 Objections were raised.
 He would not have time to prepare.
 Besides,
 even if he did have time,
 had he the ability?
 True,
 he could handle himself well in a debate on slavery or in a Cooper Union address;
 but no one had ever heard him deliver a dedicatory address.
 This was a grave and solemn occasion.
 They ought not to take any chances.
 Should they ask him to speak?
 They wondered,
 wondered.
 .
 .
 .
 But they would have wondered a thousand times more had they been able to look into the future and to see that this man,
 whose ability they were questioning,
 was to deliver on that occasion what is very generally accepted now as one of the most enduring addresses ever delivered by the lips of mortal man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally,
 a fortnight before the event,
 they sent Lincoln a belated invitation to make 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

a few appropriate remarks.
\begin_inset ERT

 Yes,
 that is the way they worded it:
 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

a few appropriate remarks.
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\end_inset

 Think of writing that to the President of the United States!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lincoln immediately set about preparing.
 He wrote to Edward Everett,
 secured a copy of the address that that classic scholar was to deliver;
 and,
 a day or two later,
 going to a photographer's gallery to pose for his photograph,
 Lincoln took Everett's manuscript with him and read it during the spare time that he had at the studio.
 He thought over his talk for days,
 thought over it while walking back and forth between the White House and the war office,
 thought over it while stretched out on a leather couch in the war office waiting for the late telegraphic reports.
 He wrote a rough draft of it on a piece of foolscap paper,
 and carried it about in the top of his tall silk hat.
 Ceaselessly he was brooding over it,
 ceaselessly it was taking shape.
 The Sunday before it was delivered he said to Noah Brooks:

 The little town was filled to overflowing.

 The sidewalks became clogged,
 impassable,
 men and women took to the dirt streets.

Mr.

 they demanded a speech.
 Lincoln responded with a few words which conveyed with more clearness than tact,
 perhaps,
 that he was unwilling to speak until the morrow.
 The facts are that he was spending the latter part of that evening giving his speech

 his arms hung limp,
 and his head was bowed.

Some of Lincoln's speeches,
 in which he had only a superficial interest,
 were unquestioned failures;
 but he was possessed of extraordinary power when he spoke of slavery and the union.
 Why?
 Because he thought ceaselessly on these problems and felt deeply.
 A companion who shared a room with him one night in an Illinois tavern awoke next morning at daylight to find Lincoln sitting up in bed,
 staring at the wall,
 and his first words were:

What topics ought you to speak on during the sessions of this course?
 Anything that interests you.
 If possible,
 choose your own topics;
 you will be more fortunate still if your topic chooses you.
 However,
 you will often have topics suggested for you by your instructor.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Determine your subject a week in advance,
 so that you will have time to think it over in odd moments.
 Think over it for seven days;
 dream over it for seven nights.
 Think of it the last thing when you retire.
 Think of it the next morning while you are shaving,
 while you are bathing,
 while you are riding down town,
 while you are waiting for elevators,
 for lunch,
 for appointments.
 Discuss it with your friends.
 Make it a topic of conversation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ask yourself all possible questions concerning it.
 If,
 for example,
 you are to speak on divorce,
 ask yourself what causes divorce,
 what are the effects economically,

Suppose you were going to talk on why you enrolled for this course.
 You ought then to ask yourself such questions as these:
 What are my troubles?
 What do I hope to get out of this insiruction?
 Have I ever made a public talk?
 If so,
 when?
 Where?
 What happened?
 Why do I think this training is valuable for a business man?
 Do I know men who are forging ahead commercially largely because of their self-confidence,
 their presence,
 their ability to talk convincingly?
 Do I know others who will probably never achieve a gratifying measure of success because they lack these
\begin_inset Newline newline

 positive assets?
 Be specific.
 Tell the stories of these men without mentioning their names.

\begin_layout Standard
If you stand up and think clearly and keep going for two or three minutes,
 that is all that will be expected of you during your first few talks.
 A topic,
 such as why you enrolled for this course,
 is very easy;
 that is obvious.
 If you will spend a little time selecting and arranging your material on that topic,
 you will be almost sure to remember it,
 for you will be speaking of your own observations,
 your own desires,
 your own experiences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand,
 let us suppose that you have decided to speak on your business or profession.
 How shall you set about preparing such a talk?
 You already have a wealth of material on that subject.
 Your problem,
 then,
 will be to select and arrange it.
 Do not attempt to tell us all about it in three minutes.
 It can't be done.
 The attempt will be too sketchy,
 too fragmentary.
 Take one and only one phase of your topic:
 expand and enlarge that.
 For example,
 why not tell us how you came to be in your particular business or profession?
 Was it a result of accident or choice?
 Relate your early struggles,
 your defeats,
 your hopes,
 your triumphs.
 Give us a human interest narrative,
 a real life picture based on first hand experiences.
 The truthful,
 inside story of almost any man's life-if told modestly and without offending egotism-is most entertaining.
 It is almost sure-fire speech material.
\end_layout

Or take another angle of your business:
 what are its troubles?
 What advice would you give to a young man entering it?

Or tell us about the people with whom you come in contact-the honest and dishonest ones.
 Tell us of your problems with labor,
 your problems with your customers.
 What has your business taught you about the most interesting topic in the world:
 human nature?
 If you speak about the technical side of your business,
 about things,
 your talk may very easily prove uninteresting to others.
 But people,
 personalities-one can hardly go wrong with that kind of material.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Above all else,
 don't make your talk an abstract preachment.
 That will bore us.
 Make your talk a regular layer cake of illustrations and general statements.
 Think of concrete cases you have observed,
 and of the fundamental truths which you believe those specific instances illustrate.
 You will also discover that these concrete cases are far easier to remember than abstractions;
 are far easier to talk about.
 They will also aid and brighten your delivery.

Many of our present-day gigantic enterprises were at one time one-man affairs.
 But most of them have outgrown this status.
 The reason is that,
 while every great organization is 'the lengthened shadow of one man,' business and industry are now conducted on such a colossal scale that of necessity even the ablest giant must gather about him brainy associates to help in handling all the reins.

Miss Ida M.

 told the writer that years ago,
 when she was in Paris,
 Mr.
 S.
 S.
 McClure,
 the founder of McClure's Magazine,
 cabled her to write a short article about the Atlantic Cable.
 She went to London,
 interviewed the European manager of the principal cable,
 and obtained sufficient data for her assignment.
 But she did not stop there.
 She wanted a reserve supply of facts;
 so she studied all manner of cables on display in the British Museum;
 she read books on the history of the cable and even went to manufacturing concerns on the edge of London and saw cables in the process of construction.
\end_layout

My dear sir,
 we know all about your case,
 and sympathetic allowance has been made for it.
 The assigned topics will be questions on which you have already done considerable thinking.
 Sometimes you will not be asked to plan any kind of a speech in advance;
 but you will be given an easy topic for impromptu speaking after you face your audience.
 This will afford you most useful practise in thinking on your feet-the sort of thing that you may be forced to do in business discussions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of the men who join this course are only slightly interested in learning to prepare talks in advance.
 They want to be able to think on their feet and to join in discussions that come up at various business meetings.
 Such students sometimes prefer to come to the class,
 listen,
 and then take their cue from some of the preceding speakers.
 A limited amount of this may be advisable;
 but don't
\begin_inset Newline newline

 overdo it.
 Follow the suggestions given in this chapter.
 They will give you the ease and freedom you are seeking and also the ability to prepare talks effectively.

 from eight to ten o'clock,

 That is the sure way,
 the systematic way.
 Why not try it?

SUMMARY
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I.
 When a speaker has a real message in his head and heart-an inner urge to speak,
 he is almost sure to do himself credit.
 A well-prepared speech is already nine-tenths delivered.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 2.
 What is preparation?
 The setting down of some mechanical sentences on paper?
 The memorizing of phrases?
 Not at all.
 Real preparation consists in digging something out of yourself,
 in assembling and arranging your own thoughts,
 in cherishing and nurturing your own convictions.
 (Illustrations:
 Mr.
 Jackson of New York failed when he attempted merely to reiterate another man's thoughts he had culled from an article in Forbes' Magazine.
 He succeeded when he used that article merely as a starting point for his own speechwhen he thought out his own ideas,
 developed his own illustrations.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 3.
 Do not sit down and try to manufacture a speech in thirty minutes.
 A speech can't be cooked to order like a steak.
 A speech must grow.
 Select your topic early in the week,
 think over it during odd moments,
 brood over it,
 sleep over it,
 dream over it.
 Discuss it with friends.
 Make it a topic of conversation.
 Ask yourself all possible questions concerning it.
 Put down on pieces of paper all thoughts and illustrations that come to you and keep reaching out for more.
 Ideas,
 suggestions,
 illustrations will come drifting to you at sundry timeswhen you are bathing,
 when you are driving down town,
 when you are waiting for dinner to be served.
 That was Lincoln's method.
 It has been the method of almost all successful speakers.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 4.
 After you have done a bit of independent thinking,
 go to the library and do some reading on your topic-if time permits.
 Tell the librarian your needs.
 She can render you great assistance.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 5.
 Collect far more material than you intend to use.
 Imitate Luther Burbank.
 He often produced a million plant specimens to find one or two superlatively good ones.
 Assemble a hundred thoughts;
 discard ninety.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 6.
 The way to develop reserve power is to know far more than you can use,
 to have a full reservoir of information.
 In preparing a speech,
 use the methods Arthur Dunn employed in training his salesmen to sell a breakfast food specialty,
 the methods that Ida Tarbell employed in preparing her article on the Atlantic cable.

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 I lie down.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 He lay on his bed yesterday.
\begin_inset Newline newline

 They have lain down on the whole proposition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition,
 there is another use of lie in the sense of prevarication.
 The principal parts are lie,
 lied,
 lying,
 lied.
 No examples are necessary to show the usage of these verbs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Set-Sit
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To set means to put something somewhere,
 or to make some one to sit.
 Of course,
 the latter usage is merely a corollary of the first.
 Examples are as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 To sit means to rest,
 as upon a chair with the body bent at the hips,
 or to rest upon the haunches.
 It also means to take or occupy a seat.
 Examples are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

To raise means to move upward,
 to cause to rise,
 to exalt.
 Examples are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 I am raising the floor.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 as a hill;
 to become erect;
 to emerge;
 to revolt;
 etc.
 Examples are:

 Try to feel the same sensation that you felt when you were practising diaphragmatic breathing in bed,

 Feel the bottom of your lungs expanding,
 expanding,
 expanding,
 pushing out the lower ribs to the side;
 feel the sensation under your arms;
 feel it at the back;
 feel the diaphragm being pushed down and flattening like an inverted paper dish under pressure from above;
 feel the diaphragm expanding as you place your fingers over the soft spot,

The common error in regard to speaking is the assumption that all that is necessary is to have 'something to say.' Utterly false!
 Unless that 'something to say' is said in accordance with the laws of the human mind which govern conviction,
 it might as well be spoken to the winds.
 The modern speaker must realize that besides 'something to say' he must learn how best to convey it.
 He must remember that the Chathams and the Websters and the Beechers not only had 'something to say' but that they realized that careful study had to be given to the order and manner of its presentation.

HOW FAMOUS SPEAKERS PREPARED THEIR ADDRESSES
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was present once at a luncheon of the New York Rotary Club when the principal speaker was a prominent government official.
 The high position that he occupied gave him prestige,
 and we were looking forward with pleasure to hearing him.
 He had promised to tell us about the activities of his own department;
 and it was one in which almost every New York business man was interested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He knew his subject thoroughly,
 knew far more about it than he could possibly use;
 but he had not planned his speech.
 He had not selected his material.
 He had not arranged it in orderly fashion.
 Nevertheless,
 with a courage born of inexperience,
 he plunged heedlessly,
 blindly,
 into his speech.
 He did not know where he was going,
 but he was on his way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His mind was,
 in short,
 a mere hodgepodge,
 and so was the mental feast he served us.
 He brought on the ice cream first,
 and then placed the soup before us.
 Fish and nuts came next.
 And,
 on top of that,
 there was something that seemed to be a mixture of soup and ice cream and good red herring.
 I have never,
 anywhere or at any time,
 seen a speaker more utterly confused.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had been trying to talk impromptu;
 but,
 in desperation now,
 he drew a bundle of notes out of his pocket,
 confessing that his secretary had compiled them for him-and no one questioned the veracity of his assertion.
 The notes themselves evidently had no more order than a flat car full of scrap iron.
 He fumbled through them nervously,
 glancing from one page to another,
 trying to orient himself,
 trying to find a way out of the wilderness,
 and he attempted to talk as he did so.
 It was impossible.
 He apologized and,
 calling for water,
 took a drink with a trembling hand,
 uttered a few more scattering sentences,
 repeated himself,
 dug into his notes again.
 .
 .
 .
 Minute by minute he grew more helpless,
 more lost,
 more bewildered,
 more embarrassed.
 Nervous perspiration stood out on his forehead,
 and his handkerchief shook as he wiped it away.
 We in the audience sat watching the fiasco,
 our sympathies stirred,
 our feelings harrowed.
 We suffered positive and vicarious embarrassment.
 But with more doggedness than discretion,
 the speaker continued,
 floundering,
 studying his notes,
 apologizing and drinking.
 Every one except him felt that the spectacle was rapidly approaching total disaster,
 and it was a relief to us all when he sat down and ceased his death struggles.
 It was one of the most uncomfortable audiences I have ever been in;
 and he was the most ashamed and humiliated speaker I have ever seen.
 He had made his talk as Rousseau said a love letter should be written:
 he had begun without knowing what he was going to say,
 and he had finished without knowing what he had uttered.

HOW A PRIZE-WINNING SPEECH WAS CONSTRUCTED
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is a speech that was delivered by a student of this course before the Thirteenth Annual Convention of the National Association of Real Estate Boards.
 It won first prize in competition with twenty-seven other speeches on various cities.
 This speech is well constructed,
 full of facts stated clearly,
 vividly,
 interestingly.
 It has spirit.
 It marches.
 It will merit reading and study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Mr.
 Chairman and Friends:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Back 144 years ago,
 this great nation,
 the United States of America,
 was born in my City of Philadelphia,
 and so it is quite natural that a city having such an historical record should have that strong American spirit that has not only made it the greatest industrial center in this country,
 but also one of the largest and most beautiful cities in the whole world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Philadelphia has a population close to two millions of people,
 and our city has an area that is equal to the combined size of Milwaukee and Boston,
 Paris and Berlin,
 and out of our 130 square miles of territory we have given up nearly 8,000 acres of our best land for beautiful parks,
 squares and boulevards,
 so that our people would have the proper places for recreation and pleasure,
 and the right kind of environment that belongs to every decent American.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Philadelphia,
 friends,
 is not only a large,
 clean and beautiful city,
 but it is also known everywhere as the great workshop of the world,
 and the reason it is called the workshop of the world is because we have a vast army of over 400,000 people employed in 9,200 industrial establishments that turn out one hundred thousand dollars' worth of useful commodities every ten minutes of the working day,
 and,
 according to a well-known statistician,
 there is no city in this country that equals Philadelphia in the production of woolen
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 goods,
 leather goods,
 knit goods,
 textiles,
 felt hats,
 hardware,
 tools,
 storage batteries,
 steel ships and a great many other things.
 We build a railroad locomotive every two hours day and night,
 and more than one-half the people in this great country ride in street cars made in the City of Philadelphia.
 We manufacture a thousand cigars every minute,
 and last year,
 in our 115 hosiery mills,
 we made two pairs of stockings for every man,
 woman and child in this country.
 We make more carpets and rugs than all of Great Britain and Ireland combined,
 and,
 in fact,
 our total commercial and industrial business is so stupendous that our bank clearings last year,
 amounting to thirty-seven billions of dollars,
 would have paid for every Liberty Bond in the entire country.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But,
 friends,
 while we are very proud of our wonderful industrial progress,
 and while we are also very proud of being one of the largest medical,
 art and educational centers in this country,
 yet,
 we feel a still greater pride in the fact that we have more individual homes in the City of Philadelphia than there are in any other city in the whole world.
 In Philadelphia we have 397,000 separate homes,
 and if these homes were placed on twenty-five-foot lots,
 side by side,
 in one single row,
 that row would reach all the way from Philadelphia clear through to this Convention Hall,
 at Kansas City,
 and then on to Denver,
 a distance of 1,881 miles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But,
 what I want to call your special attention to,
 is the significance of the fact,
 that tens of thousands of these homes are owned and occupied by the working people of our city,
 and when a man owns the ground upon which he stands and the roof over his head,
 there is no I.
 W.
 W.
 argument ever presented that would infect that man with those imported diseases,
 known as Socialism and Bolshevism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Philadelphia is not a fertile soil for European anarchy,
 because our homes,
 our educational institutions and our gigantic industry have been produced by that true American spirit that was born in our city,
 and is a heritage from our forefathers.
 Philadelphia is the mother city of this great country,
 and the very fountain head of American liberty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is the city where the first American flag was made;
 it is the city where the first Congress of the United States met;
 it is the city where the Declaration of Independence was signed ;
 it is the city where that best loved relic in America,
 the Liberty Bell,
 has inspired tens of thousands of our men,
 women and children,
 so that we believe,
 we have a sacred mission,
 which is not to worship the golden calf,
 but to spread the American spirit,
 and to keep the fires of freedom burning,
 so that with God's permission,
 the Government of Washington,
 Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt may be an inspiration to all humanity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us analyze that speech.
 Let us see how it is constructed,
 how it gets its effects.
 In the first place,
 it has a beginning and an ending.
 That is a rare virtue,
 my dear reader,
 more rare than you may be inclined to think.
 It starts somewhere.
 It goes there straight as wild geese on the wing.
 It doesn't dawdle.
 It loses no time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It has freshness,
 individuality.
 The speaker opens by saying something about his city that the other speakers could not possibly say about theirs:
 he points out that his city is the birthplace of the entire nation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He states that it is one of the largest and most beautiful cities in the world.
 But that claim is general,
 trite;
 standing by itself,
 it would not impress anyone very much.
 The speaker knew that;
 so he helped his audience visualize the magnitude of Philadelphia by stating it 
\begin_inset ERT

has an area equal to the combined size of Milwaukee,
 Boston,
 Paris and Berlin.
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\end_inset

 That is definite,
 concrete.
 It is interesting.
 It is surprising.
 It makes a mark.
 It drives home the idea better than a whole page of statistics would have done.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next he declares that Philadelphia is 
\begin_inset ERT

known everywhere as the great workshop of the world.
\begin_inset ERT

 Sounds exaggerated,
 doesn't it?
 Like propaganda.
 Had he proceeded immediately to the next point no one would have been convinced.
 But he doesn't.
 He pauses to enumerate the products in which Philadelphia leads the world:

 Jump back to the subject of the size of Philadelphia that he covered first and give us some fact that he forgot then?
 No,
 not at all.
 He sticks to a point until he finishes it,
 has done with it,
 and need never return to it again.
 For that we are duly grateful,
 Mr.
 Speaker.
 For what is more confusing and muddling than to have a speaker darting from one thing to
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 another and back again as erratic as a bat in the twilight?
 Yet many a speaker does just that.
 Instead of covering his points in order 1,
 2,
 3,
 4,
 5,
 he covers them as a football captain calls out signals -27,34,19,2.
 No,
 he is worse than that.
 He covers them like this-27,34,27,19,2,34,19.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But this speaker,
 however,
 steams straight ahead on schedule time,
 never idling,
 never turning back,
 swerving neither to the right nor left;
 like one of those locomotives he has been talking about.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But,
 he makes now the weakest point of his entire speech:
 Philadelphia,
 he declares,
 is

one of the largest medical,

\begin_inset ERT

 He merely announces that;
 then speeds on to something else-only twelve words to animate that fact,
 to make it vivid,
 to engrave it on the memory.
 Only twelve words lost,
 submerged,
 in a sentence containing a total of sixty-five.
 It doesn't work.
 Of course not.
 The human mind does not operate like a string of steel traps.
 He devotes so little time to this point,
 is so general,
 so vague,
 seems so unimpressed himself that the effect on the hearer is almost nil.
 What should he have done?
 He realized that he could establish this point with the selfsame technique that he just employed to establish the fact that Philadelphia is the workshop of the world.
 He knew that.
 He also knew that he would have a stop watch held on him during the contest,
 that he would have five minutes,
 not a second more;
 so he had to slur over this point or slight others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are 
\begin_inset ERT

 he visualizes the number:

So much for cold material facts.
 But they are not the stuff out of which eloquence is fashioned.
 This speaker aspired to build up to a climax,
 to touch the heart,
 to stir the feelings.
 So now on the home stretch,
 he deals with emotional material.
 He tells what the ownership of those homes means to the spirit of the city.
 He denounced

Often he called in critics to listen to him as he dictated or read his speech to them.
 He refused to debate with them the wisdom of what he had said.
 His mind was already made up on that point,
 and made up irrevocably.
 He wanted to be told,
 not what to say,
 but how to say it.
 Again and again he went over his typewritten copies,
 cutting,
 correcting,
 improving.
 That was the speech that the newspapers printed.
 Of course,
 he did not memorize it.
 He spoke extemporaneously.
 So the talk he actually delivered often differed somewhat from the published and polished one.
 But the task of dictating and revising was excellent preparation.
 It made him familiar with his material,
 with the order of his points.
 It gave him a smoothness and sureness and polish that he could hardly have obtained in any other fashion.

About this time I met with an odd volume of the Spectator.
 It was the third.
 I had never before seen any of them.
 I bought it,
 read it over and over and was much delighted with it.
 I thought the writing excellent,
 and wished,
 if possible,
 to imitate it.
 With this view I took some of the papers,
 and,
 making short hints of the sentiment
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 in each sentence laid them by a few days,
 and then,
 without looking at the book,
 try'd to compleat the papers again,
 by expressing each hinted sentiment at length,
 and as fully as it had been expressed before,
 in any suitable words that should come to hand.
 Then I compared my Spectator with the original,
 discovered some of my faults and corrected them.
 But I found a stock of words,
 and a readiness in recollecting and using them,
 which I thought I should have acquired before that time if I had gone on making verses;
 since the continual occasion for words of the same import,
 but of different length,
 to suis the measure,
 or of different sounds for the rhyme,
 would have laid me under a constant necessity of searching for variety,
 and also have tended to fix that variety in my mind,
 and make me master of it.
 Therefore I took some of the tales and turned them back again.
 I also sometimes jumbled my collections of hints into confusion,
 and after some weeks endeavored to reduce them into the best order,
 before I began to form the full sentences and compleat the paper.
 This was to teach me method in the arrangement of thoughts.
 By comparing my work afterwards with the original,
 I discovered many faults and amended them;
 but I sometimes had the pleasure of fancying that,
 in certain particulars of small import,
 I had been lucky enough to improve the method of the language,
 and this encouraged me to think I might possibly in time come to be a tolerable English writer,
 of which I was extremely ambitious.

 Don't they prevent,

Make notes,
 I repeat,

 You may wish to refer to them when you are practising your talk alone.

 but,
 like the hammer and saw and axe in a Pullman coach,
 they should be emergency tools,
 only for use in the case of a smash-up,

If you must use notes,
 make them extremely brief and write them in large letters on an ample sheet of paper.
 Then arrive early at the place where you are to speak and hide your notes behind some books on a table.
 Glance at them when you must,
 but endeavor to screen your weakness from the audience.

However in spite of all that has been said there may be times when it is the part of wisdom to use notes.
 For example,
 some men during their first few talks,
 are so nervous and self-conscious that they are utterly unable to remember their prepared speeches.
 The result?
 They shoot off at a tangent;
 they forget the material they had so carefully rehearsed;
 they drift off the high road and flounder about in a morass.
 Why should not such men hold a few very condensed notes in their hands during

 in spite of this warning,
 some of the men reading these lines will try it;
 if they do,
 when they stand up to speak they will be thinking of what?
 Of their messages?
 No,
 they will be attempting to recall their exact phraseology.
 They will be thinking backwards,
 not forwards,
 reversing the usual processes of the human mind.
 The whole exhibition will be stiff and cold and colorless and inhuman.
 Do not,

One evening we were fooling and I pretended to introduce Charlie Chaplin at a dinner.
 He had to rise and make a speech to fit the introduction.
 And out of that developed a game that we have been playing almost every night for two years.
 We three (Mary Pickford,
 Fairbanks,
 and Chaplin) each write a subject on a slip of paper and fold the
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 slips and shake them up.
 Each of us draws.
 No matter what the word is,
 each of us has to rise and talk for sixty seconds on that word.
 We never use the same word again.
 That's what keeps the stunt new.
 And we use all kinds of words.
 I remember one evening when two of the words were 'Faith' and 'Lampshades.' 'Lampshades' fell to me,
 and I had one of the hardest times I ever had,
 talking for sixty seconds on 'Lampshades.' Just try if you think it is easy.
 You start out bravely:
 'Lampshades have two uses.
 They modify and soften the glare of light,
 and they are decorative.' Then you are through unless you know a lot more about lampshades than I do.
 I got through somehow.
 But the point is how all three of us have sharpened up since we began that game.
 We know a lot more about a variety of miscellaneous subjects.
 But,
 far better than that,
 we are learning to assemble our knowledge and thoughts on any topic at a moment's notice and to give it out briefly.
 We are learning to think on our feet.
 I say 'we are learning' because we are still at this game.
 We haven't tired of it in almost two years,

 he forever after read aloud everything he wished to remember.

Dates are hard to remember because they consist of figures:
 figures are monotonously unstriking in appearance,
 and they don't take hold;
 they form no pictures,
 and so they give the eye no chance to take hold.
 Pictures can make dates stick.
 They can make nearly anything stickparticularly if you make the picture yourself.
 Indeed,
 that is the great point-make the picture yourself.
 I know about this from experience.
 Thirty years ago I was delivering a memorized lecture every night,
 and every night I had to help myself with a page of notes to keep from getting myself mixed.
 The notes consisted of beginnings of sentences,
 and were eleven in number,
 and they ran something like this:

Eleven of them.
 They initialed the brief of the lecture and protected me against skipping.
 But they all looked about alike on the page;
 they formed no picture;
 I had them by heart,
 but I could never with certainty remember the order of their succession;
 therefore,
 I always had to keep those notes by me and look at them every little while.
 Once I mislaid them;
 you will not be able to imagine the terrors of that evening.
 I now saw that I must invent some other protection.
 So I got ten of the initial letters by heart in their proper order-I,
 A,
 B,
 and so on-and I went on the platform the next night with these marked in ink on my ten finger nails.
 But it didn't answer.
 I kept track of the fingers for awhile;
 then I lost it,
 and after that I was never quite sure which finger I had used last.
 I couldn't lick off a letter after using it,
 for while that would have made success certain,
 it would also have provoked too much curiosity.
 There was curiosity enough without that.
 To the audience I seemed more interested in my finger nails than I was in my subject;
 one or two persons asked afterward what was the matter with my hands.

 I had Lincoln sprawled out in the top of a tree,

 as Professor James has sagely observed,

\end_layout

\end_inset

essentially an associating machine.
 .
 .
 .
 Suppose I am silent for a moment,
 and then say in commanding accents:
 'Remember!
 Recollect!' Does your faculty of memory obey the order,
 and reproduce any definite image from your past?
 Certainly not.
 It stands staring into vacancy,
 and asking,
 'What kind of thing do you wish me to remember?
\begin_inset ERT

 It needs,
 in short,
 a cue.
 But,
 if I say,
 remember the date of your birth,
 or remember what you had for breakfast,
 or remember the succession of notes in the musical scale;
 then your faculty of memory immediately produces the required result:
 the cue determines its vast set of potentialities toward a particular point.
 And if you now look to see how this happens,
 you immediately perceive that the cue is something contiguously associated with the thing recalled.
 The words,
 'date of my birth,' have an ingrained association with a particular number,
 month,
 and year;
 the words,
 'breakfast this morning,' cut off all other lines of recall except those which lead to coffee and bacon and eggs;
 the words,
 'musical scale,' are inveterate mental neighbors of do,
 re,
 mi,
 fa,
 sol,
 la,
 etc.
 The laws of association govern,
 in fact,
 all the trains of our thinking which are not interrupted by sensations breaking on us from without.
 What-
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 ever appears in the mind must be introduced;
 and,
 when introduced,
 it is as the associate of something already there.
 This is as true of what you are recollecting as it is of everything else you think of.
 An educated memory depends upon an organized system of associations;
 and its goodness depends on two of their peculiarities:
 first,
 on the persistency of the associations;
 and,
 second,
 on their number.
 .
 .
 .
 The 'secret of a good memory' is thus the secret of forming diverse and multiple associations with every fact we care to retain.
 But this forming of associations with a fact-what is it but thinking about the fact as much as possible?
 Briefly,
 then,
 of two men with the same outward experiences,
 the one who thinks over his experiences most,
 and weaves them into the most systematic relations with each other,

Haven't you had the experience,
 when meeting a man for the second or third time,
 to discover that although you could remember his business or profession,
 you could not recall his name?
 The reason is this:
 a man's business is something definite and concrete.
 It has a meaning.
 It will adhere like a court plaster while his meaningless name will roll away like hail falling on a steep roof.
 Consequently,
 to make sure of your ability to recall a
\begin_inset Newline newline

 man's name,
 fashion a phrase about it that will tie it up to his business.
 There can be no doubt whatever about the efficacy of this method.
 For example,
 twenty men,
 strangers to one another,
 recently met in the Penn Athletic Club of Philadelphia to study this course.
 Each man was asked to rise,
 announce his name and business.
 A phrase was then manufactured to connect the two;
 and,
 within a few minutes,
 each person present could repeat the name of every other individual in the room.
 Even to the end of the course,
 neither the names nor businesses were forgotten,
 for they were linked together.
 They adhered.

HOW TO REMEMBER DATES
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dates can best be retained by connecting them with important dates already firmly established in the mind.
 Isn't it far more difficult,
 for example,
 for an American to remember that the Suez Canal was opened in 1869 than to remember that the first ship passed through it four years after the close of the Civil War?
 If an American tried to remember that the first settlement in Australia was made in 1788,
 the date is likely to drop out of his mind like a loose bolt out of a car;
 it is far more likely to stick if he thinks of it in connection with July 4,
 1776,
 and remembers that it occurred twelve years after the Declaration of Independence.
 That is like screwing a nut on the loose bolt.
 It holds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is well to bear this principle in mind when you are selecting a telephone number.
 For example,
 the writer's phone number,
 during the war,
 was 1776.
 No one had difficulty in remembering it.
 If you can secure from the phone company some such number as 1492,
 1861,
 1865,
 1914,
 1918,
 your friends will not have to consult the directory.
 They might forget that your phone number was 1492,
 if you gave them the information in a colorless fashion;
 but would it slip their minds if you said,

HOW TO REMEMBER THE POINTS OF YOUR TALK
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are only two ways by which we can possibly think of a thing:
 first,
 by means of an outside stimulus;
 second,
 by association with something
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 already in the mind.
 Applied to speeches,
 that means just this:
 first,
 you can recall your points by the aid of some outside stimulus such as notesbut who likes to see a speaker use notes?
 Second,
 you can remember your points by associating them with something already in the mind.
 They should be arranged in such a logical order that the first one leads inevitably to the second,
 and the second to the third as naturally as the door of one room leads into another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That sounds simple,
 but it may not prove so for the beginner whose thinking powers are rendered hors de combat with fear.
 There is,
 however,
 a method of tying your points together that is easy,
 rapid,
 and all but fool-proof.
 I refer to the use of a nonsense sentence.
 To illustrate:
 suppose you wish to discuss a veritable jumble of ideas,
 unassociated and hence hard to remember,
 such as,
 for example,
 cow,
 cigar,
 Napoleon,
 house,
 religion.
 Let us see if we cannot weld those ideas like the links of a chain by means of this absurd sentence:
 
\begin_inset ERT

 will you please cover the above sentence with your hand while you answer these questions?

 the fifth;

\begin_layout Standard
Does the method work?
 It does!
 And the members of this course are urged to use it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any group of ideas can be linked together in some such fashion,
 and the more ridiculous the sentence used for the linking,
 the easier it will be to recall.

WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF A COMPLETE BREAKDOWN
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us suppose that,
 in spite of all his preparation and precaution,
 a speaker,
 in the middle of his talk,
 suddenly finds his mind a blank-suddenly finds himself staring at his hearers completely balked,
 unable to go on-a terrifying situation.
 His pride rebels at sitting down in confusion and defeat.
 He feels that he might be able to think of his next point,
 of some point,
 if he had only ten,
 fifteen seconds of grace;
 but even fifteen seconds of frantic silence before an audience would be little less than disastrous.
 What is to be done?
 When a certain well known U.
 S.
 Senator recently found himself in this situation he asked his audience if he were speaking loudly enough,
 if he could be heard distinctly in the back of the room.
 He knew that he was He was not seeking information.
 He was seeking time.
 And in that momentary pause,
 he grasped his thought and proceeded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But perhaps the best life-saver in such a mental hurricane is this:
 use the last word,
 or phrase,
 or idea in your last sentence for the beginning of a new sentence.
 This will make an endless chain that,
 like Tennyson's brook and,
 I regret to say,
 with as little purpose as Tennyson's brook,
 will run on forever.
 Let us see how it works in practise.

 talking on Business Success,

By memorizing,

natural laws of remembering

\end_inset

 are three:
 impression,
 repetition,
 association.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 3.
 Get a deep,
 vivid impression of the thing you wish to remember.
 To do that you must-
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 a.
 Concentrate.

\begin_inset Newline newline

 b.
 Observe closely.
 Get an accurate impression.

 neither will your mind retain foggy impressions.
\begin_inset Newline newline

 c.
 Get your impressions through as many of the senses as possible.

\begin_inset Newline newline

 d.
 Above all else,
 be sure to get eye impressions.
 They stick.
 The nerves leading from the eye to the brain are twenty times as large as those
\begin_inset Newline newline

 leading from the ear to the brain.
 Mark Twain could not remember the outline of his speech when he used notes;
 but when he threw away his notes and used pictures to recall his various headings,
 all his troubles vanished.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 4.
 The second law of memory is repetition.
 Thousands of Mohammedan students memorize the Koran-a book about as long as the New Testa-ment-and they do it very largely through the power of repetition.
 We can memorize anything within reason if we repeat it often enough.
 But bear these facts in mind as you repeat:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 a.
 Do not sit down and repeat a thing over and over until you have it engraved on your memory.
 Go over it once or twice,
 then drop it;
 come back later and go over it again.
 Repeating at intervals,
 in that manner,
 will enable you to memorize a thing in about one-half the time required to do it at one sitting.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 b.
 After we memorize a thing,
 we forget as much during the first eight hours as we do during the next thirty days;
 so go over your notes just a few minutes before you rise to make your talk.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 5.
 The third law of memory is association.
 The only way anything can possibly be remembered at all is by associating it with some other fact.

 To remember a stranger's name,
 ask questions about it-how is it spelled,
 etc.?
 Observe his looks sharply.
 Try to connect the name with his face.
 Find out his business and try to invent some nonsense phrase that will connect his name with his business,
 such as was done in the Penn Athletic Club group.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 8.
 To remember dates,
 associate them with prominent dates already in the mind.
 For example,
 the three hundredth anniversary of Shakespeare's birth occurred during the Civil War.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 9.
 To remember the points of your address,
 arrange them in such logical order that one leads naturally to the next.
 In addition,
 one can make a nonsense sentence out of the main points-for example,
 
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 10.
 If,
 in spite of all precautions,
 you suddenly forget what you intended to say,
 you may be able to save yourself from complete defeat by using the last words of your last sentence as the first words in a new one.
 This can be continued until you are able to think of your next point.

VOICE EXERCISE-RELAXING THE THROAT

There can be no question about that.

 A man can converse in business all day,
 month after month,
 without suffering from a sore throat.
 Why,
 then,
 should he contract that affliction when he attempts to do considerable public speaking?
 The answer can be given in one word:
 tension.
 He does not use his organs of speech properly.
 He is nervous;
 and he unconsciously contracts the muscles of his throat.
 He takes a deep breath,
 raises his chest by muscular effort and continues to hold it high by muscular effort;
 and the strain of these chest muscles tightens his throat.
 He wants to be emphatic,
 and he strains and tightens his throat.
 He wants to be heard;
 and he tries to force the words out of his throat.
 The result?
 Breathy tones,
 harsh tones,
 unpleasant tones,
 tones that will not carry.

 and the moment before the yawn breaks,
 your throat is open and relaxed.

 speak.

Practise this exercise twenty times a day.
 Start to yawn.
 Feel the lower part of your lungs filling with air,
 pushing against the lower ribs,
 the back,
 flattening and pressing down that arched muscle called the diaphragm.
 Now,
 instead of yawning,
 speak.
 Speak a musical sentence like this:
 Lovely

\begin_layout Standard
As you speak,
 feel that you are drinking in the words-not back into your throat-but up into the open chambers of your head.
 Feel the same openness in the headchambers that you feel when drinking in a deep breath through the nose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly,
 after taking in the deep breath,
 relax the chest entirely.
 Feel it pivoted on,
 riding on,
 the cushion of air inside.
 Your relaxed breast ought to ride on the breath just as your tires and your car ride on the air in the blown up inner tubes.
 If you do not relax your chest in this manner,
 the muscular effort that you use in holding it high will tighten your throat.
 On the other hand,
 do not construe this to mean that you are to have a caved-in chest as you are breathing.
 No.
 Hold the chest,
 not the shoulders,
 high during inspiration and then let the weight of it ride on the air pressure in the middle of your body.

This was brought home to me a few years ago when I was one of three judges called on to award the Curtis medal at Columbia University.
 There were half a dozen undergraduates,
 all of them elaborately trained,
 all of them anxious to acquit themselves well.
 But-with only a single exceptionwhat they were striving for was to win the medal.
 They had little or no desire to persuade.
 They had chosen their topics because these topics permitted oratorical development.
 They had no deep personal interest in the arguments they were making.
 And their successive speeches were merely exercises in the art of delivery.
 The exception was a Zulu Prince.
 He had selected as his theme 'The Contribution of Africa to Modern Civilization.' He put intense feeling into every word he uttered.
 His speech was no mere exercise;
 it was a living thing,
 born of conviction and enthusiasm.
 He
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 spoke as the representative of his people,
 of his continent;
 he had something to say that he wanted to say;
 and he said it with sympathetic sincerity.
 So we gave him the medal,
 although he was possibly no more accomplished in the art than two or three of his competitors.
 What we judges recognized was that his address had the true fire of the orator.
 In comparison with his fervid appeal,
 the other speeches were only gas-logs.

 This much is sure:
 you will never develop it by talking from the surface.
 Any discerning listener can detect whether a speaker is talking from skin-deep impressions or whether his expression is welling up from deep within him.
 So shake yourself out of your inertia.
 Put your heart in your work.
 Dig.
 Seek for the hidden resources that lie buried away inside you.
 Get the facts and the causes behind the facts.
 Concentrate.
 Dwell on them,
 brood over them until they matter to you.
 In the last analysis,
 you see it is all conditioned back upon thorough preparation and the right kind of preparation.
 Heart preparation is as essential as head preparation.

 One of the men

 in particular lacked force.
 He was talking merely because he wanted to speak,
 not because he was fired with zeal for thrift.
 The first step in training that man was to warm his mind and heart.
 I told him to go off by himself and to think over his subject until he became enthusiastic about it.
 I asked him to remember that the Probate Court Records in New York show that more than

 He burned them into his mind.
 He got a realizing sense of their importance.
 He aroused his own interest,
 stirred his own enthusiasm,
 and came to feel that his mission was almost holy.
 Then,
 when he went out to talk,
 there was a ring to his words that carried conviction.
 In fact,
 his talks on thrift attracted so much attention that he was invited to join the organization of the largest bank in America,
 and was later sent to one of its South American branches.

 As we learned in Chapter II,
 the preparation of a speech,

 does not consist in merely getting some mechanical words down on paper,

 Neither does it consist in lifting a few thoughts second hand from some book or newspaper article.
 No,

 But it does consist in digging away down deep into your own mind and heart and life,
 and bringing forth some convictions and enthusiasms that are essentially yours.
 Yours!

 Never doubt it.
 Mines of it,
 quantities of it,
 of whose existence you have never even dreamed.

 so he refused an offer of five thousand dollars for its publication.

Does that sound exaggerated?
 I recently listened to a public address by the head of a great university.
 I sat in the fourth row and could hardly hear more than half he said.
 The ambassador of an important European nation recently delivered the commencement address before Union College;
 his delivery was so flabby that his words were almost inaudible twenty feet from the platform.

If experienced speakers commit such errors,
 what is to be expected of the beginner?
 He is not used to having his voice enlarged so that it will carry over an audience;
 so,
 when he speaks with sufficient vitality,
 he will imagine that he is fairly shouting,
 and that people are ready to laugh at him.

One of the surest ways to get a student to limber up and abandon and really let himself go,
 would be to knock him down before he started.
 It would put fire and spirit and aliveness into his speech.
 Actors know the value of shaking themselves awake before they make their stage entrance.
 Houdini did it by leaping about the back stage,
 striking the air vigorously with his fists,
 sparring with an imaginary antagonist.
 Mansfield sometimes deliberately planned to work himself into a perfect rage over any pretext-perhaps it was because some stage hand was breathing too audibly-any excuse that would serve to give him the heightened energy,
 the surging of spirit that he courted.
 I have seen actors standing in the wings,
 waiting for their cues and beating their breasts savagely.
 I have sent stu dents,
 just before they spoke,
 into an adjoining room to pummel their bodies until their blood leaped and their faces and eyes glowed with life.
 I frequently force a student to preface his practise talks in this course,
 repeating the A.B.C.'s with violent gestures and all the vigor and anger that he can possibly command.
 Isn't it highly desirable to go before your hearers like a thoroughbred straining at the bit?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Immediately before you speak,
 get,
 if possible,
 a thorough rest.
 The ideal thing is to undress and go
\begin_inset Newline newline

 to bed for a few hours.
 If possible,
 follow that with a cold plunge and a vigorous rubdown.
 Better still,
 far better,
 take a swim.

Charles Frohman used to say that he hired actors because of their vitality.
 The kind of acting or speaking that counts consumes a lot of nerve force and physical energy;
 and Frohman knew it.
 I have chopped down hickory trees and split logs;
 and I have talked to audiences for two hours at a time.
 I have found one of these tasks about as exhausting as the other.
 During the War,
 Dudley Field Malone made a passionate appeal to a large audience assembled in the Century Theatre,
 New York.
 At the climax of it,
 after speaking for an hour and a half,
 he fainted from sheer exhaustion and was carried unconscious from the stage.

In 1896,
 when Bryan first ran for the presidency,
 I,
 as a boy,
 wondered why he so emphatically and so often declared that he would be elected,
 that McKinley would go down in defeat.
 The explanation is simple.
 Bryan knew that people in the mass cannot differentiate between emphasis and proof.
 He knew that if he said a thing often enough and vigorously enough,
 most of his hearers would end by believing it.

A few years ago I had to employ and train a number of public lecturers in England.
 After painful and costly trials,
 three of them had to be dismissed,
 and one had to be sent back three thousand miles to America.
 Their main trouble was that they were not genuinely interested in serving their audiences.
 They were chiefly concerned,
 not about
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 others,
 but about themselves and their pay envelopes.
 Everyone could feel it.
 They were cold to their audiences;
 and their audiences,
 in return,
 were cold to them.
 Consequently,
 these speakers remained sounding brasses and tinkling cymbals.

 Loncern implies a serious but more mild interest chan is denoted by anxiety.
 One may be concerned about the outcome of an election,
 one feels anxious and distressed about a mother hurt in an accident.
 Solicitude is a stronger word than concern;

I would simply ask her to take a deep breath,
 and note the expansion at the waist just above the diaphragm.
 Then I would ask her to say as many words as possible upon that breath,
 at the same time having the muscles adjacent to the diaphragm to support the breath;
 that is,
 to sustain it and not collapse or try to push it up.
 The trick is to get the most tone,
 not with the most breath,
 but with the least breath and especially the very least possible strain at the throat which must be kept in a floating,
 gossamer-like condition all the time.
 .

Very good,
 Madame Julia Claussen.
 We are not young girls,
 and neither are we interested in singing;
 but we are going to accept your suggestions and use them to improve our speaking voices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First,
 let us take a deep breath,
 as she suggests.
 Start to yawn as you drink it in,
 deep,
 now,
 deep;
 feel your porous lungs expanding like a toy balloon;
 feel them pushing out the lower ribs at both sides and in the back.
 Feel them shoving down and flattening out that arched muscle called the diaphragm.
 Give your principal attention to the dia-
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 phragm.
 It is a soft muscie.
 It needs strengtho ening.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now,
 before the yawn breaks,
 with your throat open,
 begin to sing 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

ah.
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

"
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Sing it for as long a time as your supply of breath will permit.
 How long will that be?
 That depends upon how good your breath control is.
 The natural tendency will be for your deep breath to rush out suddenly like air from a punctured balloon.
 Why?
 Because the lungs are elastic,
 they are expanded now,
 and they want to contract.
 The floating ribs have been pushed outward by the extending lungs;
 and they are tending now to press the air out of the lungs.
 The diaphragm,
 too,
 unless you control it,
 will quickly resume its arched position,
 pushing the breath out of the inflated porous lungs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However,
 if you permit the air to escape with a rush,
 your tones will be breathy.
 They will not be clear.
 They will not be pleasant.
 They will not have carrying power.
 How,
 then,
 are we to control this escape of carrying power?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How,
 then,
 are we to set about controlling the escape of the breath?
 Unless we are careful,
 our first tendency may be to control it by tightening the throat.
 Than that,
 what could be more ill advised?
 In the words of Madame Julia Claussen,
 the throat 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The throat should have nothing to do with the escape of the breath.
 The throat isn't pressing against our expanded lungs.
 So we should direct our control to the things that are:
 the diaphragm and the ribs.
 Control them.
 Let them press easily,
 gently,

THE NECESSITY OF PERSISTENCE

\begin_layout Standard
When we start to learn any new thing,
 like French,
 or golf,
 or public speaking,
 we never advance steadily.
 We do not improve graduallry.
 We do it by sudden jerks,
 by abrupt starts.
 Then we remain stationary a time,
 or we may even slip back and lose some of the ground we have previously gained.
 These periods of stagnation,
 or retrogression,
 are well known by all psychologists;
 and they have been named 
\begin_inset ERT

plateaus in the curve of learning.

 Students of public speaking will sometimes be stalled for weeks on one of these plateaus.
 Work as hard as they may,
 they cannot get off it.
 The weak ones give up in despair.
 Those with grit
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 persist,
 and they find that suddenly,
 overnight,
 without their knowing how or why it has happened,
 they have made great progress.
 They have lifted from the plateau like an aeroplane.
 Abruptly they have gotten the knack of the thing.
 Abruptly they have acquired naturalness and force and confidence in their speaking.

You may always,
 as we have noted elsewhere in these pages,
 experience some fleeting fear,
 some shock,
 some nervous anxiety the first few moments you face an audience.
 John Bright felt it to the end of his busy career;
 so did Gladstone;
 so did Bishop Wilberforce;
 so did a score of other eminent speakers.
 Even the greatest of the musicians have felt it in spite of their innumerable public appearances.
 Paderewski always fidgeted nervously with his cuffs immediately before he sat down at the piano.
 Nordica felt her heart racing.
 So did Sembrich.
 So did Emma Eames.
 But it vanished quickly,
 all of this audience fear,
 like a mist in the August sunshine.
\end_layout

Their experience will be yours.
 If you will but persevere,
 you will soon eradicate everything but this initial fear;
 and that will be initial fear,

 you will have control of yourself.
 You will be speaking with positive pleasure.

Lincoln knew.
 He had gone through it all.
 He had never,

 Lincoln once said he had walked and borrowed every book within fifty miles of his home.
 A log fire was usually kept going all night in the cabin.
 Sometimes he read by the light of that fire.
 There were cracks between the logs,
 and Lincoln often kept a book sticking in a crack.
 As soon as it was light enough to read in the morning,
 he rolled over on his bed of leaves,
 rubbed his eyes,
 pulled out the book and began de vouring it.

Whenever you go out of doors,
 draw the chin in,
 carry the crown of the head high and fill the lungs to the utmost;

 greet your friends with a smile and put soul into every handclasp.
 Do not fear being misunderstood and do not waste a minute thinking about your enemies.
 Try to fix firmly in your mind what you would like to do,

 without veering of direction,
 you will move straight to the goal.
 Keep your mind on the great and splendid things you would like to do,

 A ban or proclamation was issued decreeing that every tenant should bake his bread in the common oven and use the common mill.
 This came to be called the banal mill,

VOICE EXERCISE-USING THE TIP OF THE TONGUE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Caruso attributed much of his success as a singer to his extraordinary command of his tongue.
 So does Madame Galli-Curci.
 So do a host of other singers.
 Caruso trained until the tip of his tongue was extremely strong and agile.
 He made the tip do all the work while the back of the tongue lay inert and relaxed.
 That is extremely important,
 for the muscles at the back of the tongue are connected with the larynx.
 So using that part of the tongue causes unnecessary tension and constriction in the throat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the very best ways to develop strength and activity in the end of the tongue is by trilling the sound of 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
 Sound it incessantly like a tattoo.
 Imitate a machine gun in the distance.
 It is not merely a succession of R sounds that is wanted;
 it is a trill.
 Did you ever see the rattles on a rattlesnake vibrating rapidly in anger just before he strikes?
 If so,
 you will have some idea of the way the tip of your tongue ought to trill against the roof of your mouth just back of your front teeth.
 Haven't you heard a woodpecker on a rotten limb in early spring?
 The trill you make ought to be as rapid as his staccato.
 This trilling is something like the roll of a kettle drum.

A modern audience,

In the same manner,

 Then pick out some man in the audience,

 Forget there is anyone else present at all.

 If he were to stand up and talk to you,

 that process would immediately and inevitably make your talking more con-

 heartfelt and majestic manifestation of the man's own faith in those unseen realities which are eternal,

 For example,
 when his famous debates with Douglas were drawing to a close,
 when all the indications pointed to his defeat,
 he became depressed,
 his old habitual melancholy stealing over him at times,
 and imparting to his words a touching pathos.
 In one of his concluding speeches,
 he suddenly

stopped and stood silent for a moment,
 looking around upon the throng of half-indifferent,
 halffriendly faces before him,
 with those deep-sunken weary eyes that always seemed full of unshed tears.
 Folding his hands,
 as if they too were tired of the helpless fight,
 he said,
 in his peculiar monotone:
 'My friends,
 it makes little difference,
 very little difference,
 whether Judge Douglas or myself is elected to the United States Senate;
 but the great issue which we have submitted to you to-day is far above and beyond any personal interests or the political fortunes of any man.
 And my friends,'
\begin_inset Newline newline

 here he paused again,
 and the audience were intent on every word,
 'that issue will live and breathe and burn when the poor,
 feeble,
 stammering tongues of Judge Douglas and myself are silent in the grave.'

In the following excerpt from Holman's Ginger Talks,
 I have marked the places where a speaker might profitably pause.
 I do not say that these are the only places where one ought to pause,
 or even the best places.
 I say only that it is one way of doing it.
 Where to pause is not a matter of hard and fast rules.
 It is a matter of meaning and temperament and feeling.
 You might pause one place in a speech to-day,
 and in another place in the same speech to-morrow.

 Many speakers ignore their hearers,
 stare over their heads or at the floor.
 They seem to be delivering a soliloquy.
 There is no sense of communication,
 no give and take between the audience and the speaker.
 That kind of attitude would kill a conversation;
 it also kills a speech.

 Every man has the ability to deliver a talk.
 If you question this statement,
 try it out for yourself;
 knock down the most ignorant man you know;
 when he gets on his feet,
 he will probably say some things,
 and his manner of saying them will be almost

 flawless.
 We want you to take that same naturalness with you when you speak in public.
 To develop it,
 you must practise.
 Don't imitate others.
 If you speak spontaneously you will speak differently from anyone else in the world.
 Put your own individuality,
 your own characteristic manner into your delivery.

 5.
 Talk to your hearers just as if you expected them to stand up in a moment and talk back to you.

 others were deaf;
 and there was a clique,

 who declared it was sacrilegious to play on Sunday and contrary to the ideals of civilization.
 They were not amenable to reason;
 they were bereft of every fragile shred of hospitable diplomacy;
 so,
 in a fit of hysteria,
 they burst into the Italian's suite at the hotel,
 harassed the artist,
 hurled turnips and cranberries and nitro-glycerine at him and protested that he must be penalized for playing on Sunday.

Egoism is an excessive love of oneself,

 It is the very opposite of altruism.
 Self-conceit is a flattering opinion of one's own abilities.
 Egotism shows self-conceit by words and acts.
 It reveals
\begin_inset Newline newline

 egoism.
 One may be self-conceited and have the good taste to hide it;
 the egotistical man parades his importance.
 Pride is high-and sometimes ex-cessive-self-respect.
 It may be justified,
 or it may be unreasonable,
 conceit.
 A proud man may or may not reveal his pride.
 Vanity is a show of pride.
 The vain person longs to be noticed,
 and admired,
 and appraised.
 Vanity literally means empty.
 It is often applied to pride in such shallow things as dress and personal appearance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Imprudent literally means not seen before-hence not taking results into account.
 Rash originally meant quick,
 and has now come to mean overhasty.
 A rash man does things on a momentary impulse,
 without deliberation.
 Foolhardy literally means a brave fool.
 The adventurous man gets a pleasure out of incurring risks.
 The adventurous man would rather conduct concert tours than to have an established hardware business.
 Precipitate,
 like the word precipice,
 is derived from two Latin words and literally means head before or headlong.
 A precipitate action is like plunging headlong over a cliff.
 Other words with somewhat similar meanings are:

For some strange reason,
 practising the falsetto voice develops a bright quality in our ordinary speaking tones.
 Do you know what we mean by the falsetto?
 I think you can get it by following these directions:
 pitch your voice in the highest tones of which you are capable-almost a shriek.
 It is a funny tone,
 very effeminate.
 It will soon tire you.
 Don't practise it after you begin to feel a strain.

The poet Longfellow advised the famous Shakespearean actress,

 The happiness tones,

 If you read aloud hopeful,

How truly language must be regarded as a hindrance to thought,
 though the necessary instrument of it,
 we shall clearly perceive on remembering the comparative force with which simple ideas are communicated by signs.
 To say 'Leave the room' is less expressive than to point to the door.
 Placing the finger on the lips is more forcible than whispering 'Do not speak.' A beck of the hand is better than 'Come here.' No phrase can convey the idea of surprise so vividly as opening the eyes and raising the eyebrows.

I have often seen this illustrated by the open air speakers in Hyde Park,

 one can take his choice and listen to a Catholic explaining the doctrine of the infallibility of the Pope,
 to a Socialist propounding the economic gospel of Karl Marx,
 to an Indian explaining why it is right and proper for a Mohammedan to have four wives,
 and so on.
 Hundreds crowd about one speaker,
 while his neighbor has only a handful.
 Why?
 Is the topic always an adequate explanation of the disparity between the drawing powers of different speakers?
 No.
 More often the explanation is to be found in the speaker himself:
 he is more interested and,
 consequently,
 interesting.
 He talks with more life and spirit.
 He radiates vitality and animation;
 they always challenge attention.

An inquiry was sent to a large group of people by a psychologist and university president,

 All but unanimously,
 they testified that when they were well groomed and faultlessly and immaculately attired,
 the knowledge of it,
 the feeling of it,
 had an effect which,
 while it was difficult to explain,
 was still very definite,
 very real.
 It gave them more confidence;
 brought them increased faith in themselves;
 heightened their self-respect.
 They declared that when they had the look of success they found it easier to think success,
 to achieve success.
 Such is the effect of clothes on the wearer himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What effect do they have on an audience?
 I have noticed time and again that if a speaker has baggy trousers,
 shapeless coat and footwear,
 fountain pen and pencils peeping out of his breast pocket,
 a newspaper or a pipe and can of tobacco bulging out the sides of his garment-I have noticed that an audience has as little respect for that man as he has for his own appearance.

A number of years ago I was writing for the American Magazine the life story of a certain New York banker.

 At first thought,
 that may sound like exaggeration but I believe it is really true.
 Other men,
 scores of them,
 hundreds of them,
 may have had more experience and as good financial judgment,
 but he had an additional asset they didn't possess-he had a most agreeable personality.
 And a warm,
 welcoming smile was one of the striking features of it.
 It gained one's confidence immediately.
 It secured one's good will instantly.
 We all want to see a man like that succeed;

For the same reason,

NO GUESTS ON THE PLATFORM

\begin_layout Standard
I was once in London,
 Ontario,
 when the Prime Minister of Canada was speaking.
 Presently the janitor,
 armed with a long pole,
 started to ventilate the room,
 moving about from window to window.
 What happened?
 The audience,
 almost to a man,
 ignored the speaker for a little while and stared at the janitor as intently as if he had been performing some miracle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An audience cannot resist-or,

First,
 he can refrain from twiddling his thumbs,
 playing with his clothes and making little nervous movements that detract from him.

Second,
 the speaker should arrange,

 to have the audience seated so they won't have their attention distracted by seeing the late comers enter.

Third,
 he should have no guests on the platform.
 A few years ago Raymond Robins delivered a series of talks in Brooklyn.
 I,
 along with a number of others,
 was invited to sit on the platform with him.
 I declined on the ground that it was unfair to the speaker.
 I noted the first night how many of these guests shifted about and put one leg over the other and back again,
 and so on;
 and every time one of them moved,
 the audience looked away from the speaker to the guest.
 I called Mr.
 Robins' attention to this the next day;
 and during the remainder of his evenings with us,
 he very wisely occupied the platform alone.

We just said,

 not to play with your clothes because it attracted attention.
 There is another reason also.
 It gives an impression of weakness,
 a lack of self-control.

 There are no neutral movements.
 None.
 So stand still and control yourself physically and that will give you an impression of mental control,
 of poise.

 I have heard a number of the celebrated speakers of this generation.
 Many,
 if not most,
 put their hands into their pockets occasionally while speaking.
 Bryan did it.
 Chauncey M.
 Depew did it.
 Teddy Roosevelt did it.
 Even so fastidious a dandy as Disraeli sometimes succumbed to this temptation.
 But the sky did not fall and,
 according to the weather reports,
 if my memory serves me right,
 the sun came up on time as usual the next morning.
 If a man has something to say worth while,
 and says it with contagious conviction,
 surely it will matter little what he does with his hands and feet.
 If his head is full and heart stirred,
 these secondary details will very largely take care of themselves.
 After all,
 the stupendously important thing in making a talk is the psychological aspect of it,
 not the position of the hands and feet.

ABSURD ANTICS TAUGHT IN THE NAME OF GESTURE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And this brings us very naturally to the muchabused question of gesture.
 My first lesson in public speaking was given by the president of a college in the middle west.
 This lesson,
 as I remember it,
 was chiefly concerned with gesturing;
 it was not only useless but misleading and positively harmful.
 I was taught to let my arm hang loosely at my side palm facing the rear,
 fingers half closed and thumb touching my leg.
 I was drilled to bring the arm up in a graceful curve,
 to make a classical
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 swing with the wrist and then to unfold the forefinger first,
 the second finger next,
 and the little finger last.
 When the whole aesthetic and ornamental movement had been executed,
 the arm was then to retrace the same graceful and unnatural curve and rest again by the side of the leg.
 The whole performance was wooden and affected.
 There was nothing sensible or honest about it.
 I was drilled to act as no man,
 in his right mind,
 ever acted anywhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was no attempt whatever to get me to put my own individuality into my movements;
 no attempt to spur me on to feeling like gesturing;
 no endeavor to get the flow and blood of life in the process,
 and make it natural and unconscious and inevitable;
 no urging me to let go,
 to be spontaneous,
 to break through my shell of reserve,
 to talk and act like a human being.
 No,
 the whole regrettable performance was as mechanical as a typewriter,
 as lifeless as a last year's bird nest,
 as ridiculous as a Punch and Judy show.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was in 1902.
 It seems incredible that such absurd anties could have been taught in the twentieth century;
 but they are still going on.
 Only a few years ago a whole book about gesturing was published by a professor teaching in one of the large colleges of the East-a whole book trying to make automatons out of men,
 telling them which gesture to make on this sentence,
 which to make on that,
 which to make with one hand,
 which with both,
 which to make high,
 which to make medium,
 which to make low,
 how to hold this finger and how to hold that.
 I have seen twenty men at a time stand-
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 ing before a class,
 all reading the same ornate oratorical selections from such a book,
 all making precisely the same gestures on precisely the same words,
 and all making themselves precisely ridiculous.
 Artificial,
 time-killing,
 mechanical,
 injurious-it has brought this whole subject into disrepute with many men.
 The dean of a large college in Massachusetts recently said that his institution had no course in public speaking because he had never seen one that was practical,
 one that taught men to speak sensibly.
 My sympathy was all with the dean.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nine-tenths of the stuff that has been written on gestures has been a waste and worse than a waste of good white paper and good black ink.
 Any gesture that is gotten out of a book is very likely to look like it.
 The place to get it is out of yourself,
 out of your heart,
 out of your mind,
 out of your own interest in the subject,
 out of your own desire to make some one else see as you see,
 out of your own impulses.
 The only gestures that are worth one,
 two,
 three,
 are those that are born on the spur of the instant.
 An ounce of spontaneity is worth a ton of rules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gesture is not a thing to be put on at will like a dinner jacket.
 It is merely an outward expression of inward condition just as are kisses and colic and laughter and sea sickness.

did not gesticulate as much with his hands as with his head.
 He used the latter frequently,
 throwing it with vim this way and that.
 This movement was a significant one when he sought to enforce his statement.
 It sometimes came with a quick jerk,
 as if throwing off electric sparks into combustible material.
 He never sawed the air or rent space into tatters and rags as some orators do.
 He never acted for stage effect.
 .
 .
 .
 As he moved along in his speech he became freer and less uneasy in his movements;
 to that extent he was graceful.
 He had a perfect naturalness,
 a strong individuality;
 and to that extent he was dignified.
 He despised glitter,
 show,
 set forms and shams.
\begin_inset Newline newline

 There was a world of meaning and emphasis in the long,
 bony finger of his right hand as he dotted the ideas on the minds of his hearers.
 Sometimes,
 to express joy or pleasure,
 he would raise both hands at an angle of about fifty degrees,
 the palms upward,
 as if desirous of embracing the spirit of that which he loved.
 If the sentiment was one of detes-tation-denunciation of slavery,
 for example-both arms,
 thrown upward and fists clenched,
 swept through the air,
 and he expressed an execration that was truly sublime.
 This was one of his most effective gestures,
 and signified most vividly a fixed determination to drag down the object of his hatred
\begin_inset Newline newline

 and trample it in the dust.
 He always stood squarely on his feet,
 toe even with toe;
 that is,
 he never put one foot before the other.
 He neither touched nor leaned on anything for support.
 He made but few changes in his positions and attitudes.
 He never ranted,
 never walked backward and forward on the platform.
 To ease his arms,
 he frequently caught hold,
 with his left hand,
 of the lapel of his coat,
 keeping his thumb upright and leaving his right hand free to gesticulate.

And such is the way you,

\begin_layout Section*
SUGGESTIONS THAT MAY PROVE HELPFUL
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here are,
 however,
 a few limited suggestions that may prove useful.
 Do not repeat one gesture until it becomes monotonous.
 Do not make short,
 jerky movements from the elbow.
 The movements from the shoulder look better on the platform.
 Do not end your gestures too quickly.
 If you are using the index finger to drive home your thought,
 do not be afraid to hold that gesture through an entire sentence.
 The failure to do this is a very common
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 error and a serious one.
 It distorts your emphasis,
 making small things unimportant,
 and truly important points seem trivial by comparison.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you are doing real speaking before a real audience,
 make only the gestures that come natural.
 But while you are practising before the members of this course,
 force yourself,
 if necessary,
 to use gestures.
 Force yourself to do it and,
 as I pointed out in Chapter V,
 the doing of it will so awaken and stimulate you that your gestures will soon be coming unsought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shut your book.
 You can't learn gestures from a printed page.
 Your own impulses,
 as you are speaking,
 are more to be trusted,
 more valuable than anything any instructor can possibly tell you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you forget all else we have said about gesture and delivery,
 remember this:
 if a man is so wrapped up in what he has to say,
 if he is so eager to get his message across that he forgets himself and talks and acts spontaneously,
 then his gestures and his delivery,
 unstudied though they may be,
 are very likely to be almost above criticism.
 If you doubt this,
 walk up to a man and knock him down.
 You will probably discover that,
 when he regains his feet,
 the talk he delivers will be well nigh flawless as a gem of eloquence.

A seed house in Honolulu sent its catalog to the address of a certain adult whose domicile was on the banks of a creek near the Zoological gardens in Toledo.
 This poor fellow was a drug addict.
 When he was under the influence of opium,
 he marveled at the surprisingly beautiful pictures of tomatoes and parsnips and melons in the sales literature.
 He dreamed dreams.
 .
 .
 .
 In spite of the fact that he was a poor man,
 and,
 at times,
 found it difficult to keep a roof over his head,
 nevertheless,
 he now ordered surprisingly large quantities of seeds,
 far larger quantities than were justifiable,
 considering his finances.
 For some inexplicable reason,
 the credulous chap felt that he could make a fortune raising produce;
 so,
 in order to collect cash,
 he voluntarily sold his piano,
 his spoons,
 his cigar store coupons,
 the carburetor of his Ford,
 the broom that swept his rooms and even the very food in his domicile.
 He wrote the Honolulu concern,
 saying:

 At times,
 I also have a pain in the abdomen due to indigestion,
 but as soon as I put a flower on my coat,

 and the roots of a cranberry bush.

VOICE EXERCISE-REVIEW
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Here is an exercise that Lamperti,
 the famous Italian voice teacher,
 insisted that his students practise daily.
 It is the foundation exercise of breath technique.
 Relax the jaw,
 let it fall open.
 Feel an incipient yawn in the throat.
 Now begin by taking in and letting out very short breaths through the mouth.
 Increase their rapidity until they sound like the panting of a dog that has been running.
 This panting sound should be the result of the expelled breath striking against the hard palate of the
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 mouth.
 It should not come from a narrow,
 constricted throat.
 Where should the motive power for this pant come from?
 From the diaphragm.
 It is acting like a bellows to force the air out in quick spurts.
 It is fairly pumping it out.
 You cannot help but feel its action in the middle of your body.
 Put your hand directly underneath your breast bone and feel its motion there.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Relax;
 feel in the throat the cool,
 delightful sensation of an oncoming yawn;
 drink in a deep breath of air;
 feel your lungs pushing out the lower ribs at your sides,
 pushing and flattening the arched diaphragm.
 Now let us try controlling,
 by means of the diaphragm,
 the release of this air.
 Hold a lighted candle close to your mouth.
 See if you can empty your lungs now so slowly,
 so evenly,
 that the flame of the candle will not flicker in the slightest even though it is held quite close to the mouth.
 You should practise this until you can exhale steadily for thirty or forty seconds without disturbing the flame of the candle.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But this exercise will be worse than useless if you constrict your throat.
 The release of the air must be controlled from the center of body.
 Never forget that.
 It must be controlled down there where you felt that pumping exercise when you were panting.

Try this exercise three or four times.
 Then blow out the candle by one gust of air forced up by a violent contraction of the diaphragm.

 Think of the tone as coming in and up as in a yawning,

 Keep the throat open.
 Keep always an ample reserve of breath in the lungs.
 Strike off the emphatic ideas with the tip of your tongue.
 Feel it hitting neatly,
 quickly,

 Do these things;

Be not too tame neither,

 for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing,
 whose end,
 both at the first and now,
 was and is,
 to hold,
 as 'twere,
 the mirror up to nature;
 to show virtue her own feature,
 scorn her own image,
 and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure.

 the novice often feels that he ought to be funny as a speaker.
 He may,
 by nature,
 mind you,
 be as solemn as the encyclopedia,
 utterly devoid of the lighter touch;
 yet the moment he stands up to talk he imagines he feels,
 or ought to feel,
 the spirit of Mark Twain descending upon him.
 So he is inclined to open with a humorous story,
 especially if the.
 occasion is an after-dinner affair.
 What happens?
 The chances are twenty to one that the narration,
 the manner of this hardware merchant newly-turned raconteur,
 is as heavy as the dictionary.

In all the difficult realm of speech-making,

 Humor is a hair trigger affair;

Remember,
 it is seldom the story that is funny of,

 It is the way it is told that makes it a success.
 Ninety-nine men out of a hundred will fail woefully with the identical stories that made Mark Twain famous.
 Read the stories that Lincoln repeated in the taverns of the Eighth Judicial District of Illinois,
 stories that men drove miles to hear,

 stories that,
 according to an eye witness,
 sometimes caused the natives to

Were you to study his speeches,

 Edwin James Cattell confided to me that he had never told a funny story for the mere sake of humor.
 It had to be relevant,
 had to rillustrate a point.
 Humor ought to be merely the frosting on the cake,
 merely the chocolate between the layers,

My Lords,

 I used to visit my friends in jail when they were doing their sentences.

 as an afterdinner speaker,
 was an audience intelligent and well-educated but half-tight.
 (Laughter and applause.) Now,

 a story,
 which was destined to become immortal.
 Many people have called it 'the greatest little book in the world.' When it first appeared,
 friends meeting one another on the Strand or Pall Mall,
 asked the question,
 'Have you read it?' The answer invariably was:

 By telling the history of the Life Extension Institute,
 how it was organized and the service it was rendering.
 Absurd!
 Our hearers have not the foggiest,

 interest in how some company somewhere was formed;
 but they are stupendously and eternally interested in themselves.

Do you know how long you are expected to live according to life insurance tables?
 Your expectancy of life,
 as insurance statisticians phrase it,
 is two-thirds of the time between your present age and eighty.
 For example,
 if you are thirty-five now,
 the difference between your present age and eighty is fortyfive;
 you can expect to live two-thirds of that amount,
 or another thirty years.
 .

 Is that enough?
 No,
 no,
 we are all passionately eager for more.
 Yet those tables are based upon millions of records.
 May you and I,
 then,
 hope to beat them?
 Yes,

 From that sentence,
 he went on to show that we were wasting our timber at a shameless and indefensible pace.
 But the opening was bad,
 too general,
 too vague.
 He did not make his subject seem vital to us.
 There was a printer in that audience.
 The destruction of our forests will mean something very real to his business.
 There was a banker;
 it is going to affect him for it will affect our general prosperity.

It was on December 12th that a high school girl of fifteen in that city met for the first time a junior in a nearby college who had just attained his majority.
 On December 15th,
 only three days later,
 they procured a marriage license by swearing that the girl was eighteen and was therefore free from the necessity of procuring parental consent.
 Leaving the city clerk's office with their license,
 they applied at once to a priest (the girl was a Catholic),
 but very properly he refused to marry them.
 In some way,
 perhaps through this priest,
 the child's mother received news of the attempted marriage.
 Before she could find her daughter,
 however,
 a justice of the peace had united the pair.
 The bridegroom then took his bride to a hotel where they spent two days and two nights,
 at the end of which time he abandoned her and never lived with her again.

\begin_layout Standard
I.
 The opening of a talk is difficult.
 It is also highly important,
 for the minds of our hearers are fresh then and comparatively easy to impress.
 It is of too much consequence to be left to chance;
 it ought to be carefully worked out in advance.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 2.
 The introduction ought to be short,
 only a sentence or two.
 Often it can be dispensed with altogether.
 Wade right into the heart of your subject with the smallest possible number of words.
 No one objects to that.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 3.
 Novices are prone to begin either with attempting to tell a humorous story or by making an apology.
 Both of these are usually bad.
 Very few men-very,
 very,
 very few-can relate a humorous anecdote successfully.
 The attempt usually embarrasses the audience instead of entertaining them.
 Stories should be relevant,
 not dragged in just for the sake of the story.
 Humor should be the icing on the cake,
 not the cake itself.
 .
 .
 .
 Never apologize.
 It is usually an insult to your audience;
 it bores them.
 Drive right into what you have to say,
 say it quickly and sit down.

Once upon a time,

 With the advent of spring,
 a hunger for romance stole over him,
 and he was unable to combat it.
 It was so exquisite,
 so formidable,
 so inexplicable,
 so delicious,
 so dolorous,
 so shaking and quaking,
 that he did not even desire to combat it.
 He felt that no one in the wide domains of his native land could understand the marvelous melody that swept through his heart.

 quently,
 he began to frequent the harbor,
 watching the stately ships sail in with high masts through the mists.
 His finances hardly permitted travel;
 so he went about incognito,
 using an alias,
 while he sold alternately brooms and cigar store coupons until he was able to stand the financial strain of a trip to Seattle.
 There he met a fragile widow,
 who had also recently divorced a drug addict.
 Although he was not conversant with her language,
 he was an expert flatterer.
 However,
 she was tepid to his advances.
 She counted the cost because she did not want to marry in haste when her own mind was hazy.
 She hissed in his face that she was not interested in his proposal,
 that marriage with him would be horrid,
 despicable,
 contrary to her ideals.
 He received his chastisement in silence,
 tore up the trousseau that he had depleted his finances to purchase,
 and,
 moaning and groaning,
 he sailed back to Honolulu.

\begin_layout Standard
The fair man attempts to be honest and just and impartial.
 The open man speaks freely and exactly what is in his mind.
 The frank man does it from a natural dislike of restraint.
 The ingenuous man
\begin_inset Newline newline

 has a natural simplicity and regard for truth that prompt him to confess his faults and to speak without any reserve.
 (Ingenuous must not be confused with ingenious,
 meaning clever at contriving,
 deverly contrived.) The sincere man never pretends to be anything that he is not;
 he is genuine,
 real.
 A man who speaks openly on occasions may not naturally be frank and fair.
 A frank man may not go so far in his outspokenness and confessions as the ingenuous person.
 The sincere man may not speak freely,

VOICE EXERCISE-RELAXING THE JAW
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the voice exercises for Chapters III and IV we pointed out the necessity for relaxation,
 especially of the throat.
 The jaw also should be relaxed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of us are inclined to hold it rigidly.
 And what is the result?
 The tone is forced to squeeze itself out;
 so it becomes thin and hard.
 Such a tone,
 made under such conditions,
 does not carry well.
 Our breath is molded into words in our mouth very largely by means of our lips and tongue-the tongue playing the principal part.
 The set jaw distorts this mouth-mold,
 and interferes with the beauty and precision of the sounds which should flow from it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Besides,
 stiff jaws are very liable to result in clumsy tongues;
 but it is tongue speed and firmness and elasticity that we prize.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Drop the head on the breast,
 until your chin is touching your shirt.
 Raise all of the head now except the lower jaw.
 If you relax it thoroughly,
 gravity will hold it down just as gravity pulls your hands down to your sides when you relax them.

 Open the jaw deliberately.
 Chew as if you were masticating your food.
 Note the action underneath your finger tips.

 surrender the jaw this time and let it fall of its own dead weight.
 If you have done it correctly,
 if you have not used force,
 you will not feel the action under your finger tips this time that you felt before.

You must please the audience.
 You must lull their fears,
 dissipate their suspicions,
 get them to lay down their arms and say,
 'Come let us reason together.' This you will do by finding some common grounds and mutual interest.
 There are things which bind us that are stronger than the forces that sever.
 What are they?
 On your discovery of that will depend the success of your speech.
 If you really cannot please the audience,
 then show a splendid courage and extort their admiration and respect.
 As an illustration of the first,
 if I were addressing an audience of Orangemen in Belfast I should pay a tribute to loyalty to conscience.
 I should speak of our common admiration for our great ancestors,
 that is,
 of the things which we had in common.
 If I were addressing employees I should not start with raging rebukes,
 but seek to remind them of happier occasions,
 of loyal coüperation in the past,
 of the worries and troubles that press upon all engaged in industry.
 I should let them see that I was sincerely and without bitterness seeking a way out.
 In every case appeal to the best instincts in the audience;
 it is amazing how a group of people will respond to such an appeal.

Several years ago the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company was suffering from labor troubles.
 Shooting had taken place;
 there had been bloodshed.
 The air was electric with bitter hatreds.
 The very name of Rockefeller was anathema.
 Yet John D.
 Rockefeller,

 wanted to talk to the employes of that concern.
 He wanted to explain,
 to persuade them to his way of thinking,
 to get them to accept his beliefs.
 He realized that,
 in the very opening of his speech,
 he must eradicate all ill feeling,
 all antagonism.
 At the very outset,
 he did it beautifully and sincerely.

True,

 but aren't you,
 almost every day of your life,
 talking to people who differ from you on some subject under discussion?
 Aren't you constantly trying to win people to your way of think-ing-at home,
 in the office,
 in the market place?
 Is there room for improvement in your methods?
 How do you begin?
 By showing Lincoln's tact?
 And Rockefeller's?
 If so,
 you are a person of rare finesse and extraordinary discretion.
 Most men begin,
 not by thinking about the other fellow's views and desires,
 not by trying to find a common

 ground of agreement,
 but by unloading their own opinions.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 For example,
 I have heard hundreds of speeches on the hotly contested subject of prohibition.
 In almost every instance,
 the speaker,
 with all the tact of a bull in a china shop,
 opened with some positive and perhaps belligerent statement.
 He showed once and for all which direction he faced and under which flag he fought.
 He showed that his mind was made up so firmly that there was not the slightest chance of it being changed;
 yet he was expecting others to abandon their cherished beliefs and to accept his.
 The effect?
 About the same that results from all arguments:
 no one was convinced.
 Instantly,
 he lost by his blunt,
 aggressive opening the sympathetic attention of all who differed with him;
 instantly,
 they discounted all he said and would say;
 instantly,
 they challenged his statements;
 instantly,
 they held his opinions in contempt.
 His talk served but to entrench them more strongly behind the bulwark of their own beliefs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You see,
 he made,
 at the very outset,
 the fatal mistake of prodding his listeners,
 of getting them bending backwards and saying through their shut teeth:

A 'No' response is a most difficult handicap to overcome.
 When a person has said 'No,' all his pride of personality
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 demands that he remain consistent with himself.
 He may later feel that the 'No' was ill advised;
 nevertheless,
 there is his precious pride to consider!
 Once having said a thing,
 he must stick to it.
 Hence it is of the very greatest importance that we start a person in the affirmative direction.

 The skillful speaker gets 
\begin_inset ERT

at the outset a number of 'yes-responses.' He has thereby set the psychological processes of his listeners moving in the affirmative direction.
 It is like the movement of a billiard ball.
 Propel it in one direction,
 and it takes some force to deflect it;
 far more force to send it back in the opposite direction.

The psychological patterns here are quite clear.
 Wher a person says 'No' and really means it,
 he is doing far more than saying a word of two letters.
 His entire organ-ism-glandular,
 nervous,
 muscular-gathers itself together into a condition of rejection.
 There is,
 usually in minute but sometimes in observable degree,
 a physical withdrawal,
 or readiness for withdrawal.
 The whole neuro-muscular system,
 in short,
 sets itself on guard against acceptance.
 Where,
 on the contrary,
 a person says 'Yes,' none of the withdrawing activities take place.
 The organism is in a forward-moving,
 accepting,
 open attitude.
 Hence the more 'Yesses' we can,
 at the very outset,
 induce,
 the more likely we are to succeed in capturing the attention for our ultimate proposal.

 and immediately he must make them furious!
 What,
 as a matter of fact,
 is the good of it?
 If he simply does it in order to get some pleasure out of it for himself,
 he may be pardoned.
 But if he expects to achieve something,
 he is only psychologically stupid.

SENATOR LODGE'S WAY OF DOING IT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shortly after the close of the World War,
 the late Senator Lodge and President Lowell of Harvard were scheduled to debate the League of Nations question before a Boston audience.
 Senator Lodge felt that most of the audience were hostile to his view;
 yet he must win them to his way of thinking.
 How?
 By a direct,
 frontal,
 aggressive attack on their convictions?
 Ah,
 no.
 The Senator was far too shrewd a psychologist to bungle his plea with such crude tactics.
 He began with supreme tact,
 with admirable finesse.
 The opening of his speech is quoted in a following paragraph.
 Note that even his most bitter opponents could not have differed with the sentiments expressed in his first dozen sentences.
 Note how he appeals to their emotion of patriotism in his salutation:

 how he insists upon the fact that they differ only on minor details of method,

 So,
 in the last analysis,
 he differed from his opponent only in this:
 he felt that we ought to have a more ideal and efficacious League.

We sometimes find ourselves changing our minds without any resistance or heavy emotion,

 It is obviously not the ideas themselves that are dear to us,
 but our self-esteem which is threatened.

 are subject to revision.

 We like to continue to believe what we have been accustomed to accept as true,

 This is no time for ceremony.
 The question before the house is one of awful moment to the country.
 For my own part,
 I consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom or slavery.
 And in proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the debate.
 It is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth,
 and fulfill the great responsibility which we hold to God and our country.
 Should I keep back my opinions at such a time,
 through fear of giving offense,
 I should consider myself as guilty of treason towards my country,
 and of an act of disloyalty toward the Majesty of Heaven,
 which I revere above al earthly things.

THE BEST SPEECH SHAKESPEARE WROTE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most famous speech that Shakespeare put into the mouth of any of his characters-Mark Antony's funeral oration over the body of Julius Cæsar-is a classic example of supreme tact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This was the situation.
 Cæsar had become dictator.
 Naturally,
 inevitably,
 a score of his political enemies were envious,
 were eager to tear him down,
 to destroy him,
 to make his power their own.
 Twenty-three of them banded together under the leadership of Brutus and Cassius and thrust their daggers into his body.
 .
 .
 .
 Mark Antony had been Cæsar's Secretary of State.
 He was a handsome chap,
 this Antony,
 a ready writer,
 a power ful speaker.
 He could represent the government well at public affairs.
 Small wonder Cæsar had chosen him as his right hand man.
 Now,
 with Cæsar out of the way,
 what should the conspirators do with Antony?
 Remove him?
 Kill him?
 There had been enough blood shed already;
 there was enough to justify as it was.
 Why not win this Antony to their side,
 why not use his undeniable influence,
 his moving eloquence,
 to shield them and further their own ends?
 Sounded safe and reasonable;
 so they tried it.
 They saw him and went so far as to permit him to

 Before him lies the murdered Cæsar.
 A mob surges

 noisily and threateningly about Antony,
 a rabble friendly to Brutus,
 Cassius and the other assassins.
 Antony's purpose is to turn this popular enthusiasm into intense hatred,
 to stir the plebeians to rise in mutiny and slay those that had struck Cæsar down.
 He raises his hands,
 the tumult ceases,
 he starts to speak.
 Note how ingeniously,
 how adroitly he begins,
 praising Brutus and the other conspirators:

 But there is another reason,
 entirely aside from the one we are considering now,
 why Shakespeare ought to be read and reread by business men;
 he possessed a larger vocabulary than did any other writer who ever lived;
 he used words more magically,
 more beautifully.
 No one can study Macbeth and Hamlet and Julius Cæsar without unconsciously brightening and widening and refining his own diction.

 O,

 Look you here,

The most famous speech that Shakespeare ever wrote is Mark Antony's funeral oration over Cæsar.
 It is a classic example of supreme tact.
 The Roman populace is friendly to the conspirators.
 Note how adroitly Antony turns this friendliness into a fury of hate.
 Note that he does it without arguing.
 He presents the facts,
 and lets them form their own opinions.

Even in a speaker of recognized ability,
 his mispronunciations fall harshly upon the ear and cause the hearers to suspect that his early,
 if not his later,
 education,
 has been wanting in polish;
 or (what is,
 perhaps,
 more to his detriment) that he has not been accustomed to the society of refined and cultivated people.

New Study Material.
 Rule:
 The various forms of the verb to be-am,
 is,
 are,
 was,
 were,
 has been,
 can be,
 could be,
 will be,
 shall be,
 would be,
 should be,
 may be-are followed by the nominative case.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right:
 If you were 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

,
 what would you say?
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 Wrong:

 what would you say?
\begin_inset Newline newline

 Wrong:

\begin_inset Newline newline

 Right:

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 Wrong:
 I thought it was her.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 Right:
 It is we who are to blame.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 Wrong:
 It is 
\begin_inset Formula $us$
\end_inset

 who are to blame.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 Rule:
 There are seemingly two exceptions to the first rule given above.
 When it precedes to be or to have been,
 the verb form is followed by the objective case of the pronoun.
 Other subjects may be used like the word 
\begin_inset Formula $it$
\end_inset

 in such construction.
 Examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right:
 I know it to be her.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 Wrong:
 I know it to be she.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 Right:
 I know Mary to be her.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 Wrong:
 I know Mary to be she.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 Right:
 She supposed it to have been them.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 Wrong:
 She supposed it to have been they.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 Right:
 She supposed the robbers to have been them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wrong:
 She supposed the robbers to have been they.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rule:
 If to be or to have been do not have it immediately in front of them,
 the verb form is followed by the nominative case of the pronoun just the same as in the first rule in this lesson.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right:
 It was believed to be she.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 Wrong:
 It was believed to be her.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 Right:
 It was supposed to have been they.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 Wrong:
 It was supposed to have been them.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 Rule:
 Sometimes the subject of the principal
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 verb of the sentence is the same as the one used wich to be or to have been.
 In this instance,
 the infinitive form is followed by the nominative case.
 Examples are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right:
 Mary was believed to be she.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 Wrong:
 Mary was believed to be her.
\begin_inset Newline newline

 Right:
 Mary was supposed to have been she.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 Wrong:

 Who is used to refer to persons only.

VOICE EXERCISE-FLEXIBILITY OF THE LIPS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nervous tension-and the beginning speaker is almost always troubled with it,
 especially at the out set of his talk-is very liable to manifest itself by tightening the muscles of the throat,
 and stiffening the jaws and lips.
 We have dealt in previous chapters with directions for the relaxation of the throat and jaw.
 Let us turn our attention now to stiff,
 inflexible lips.
 They are a handicap,
 a liability.
 The lips ought to be free and flexible to aid in the molding of clear and beautiful tones.
 You can possess this additional attractiveness and carrying power in your tones,
 if you are willing to pay for it with attention and practise.
 All we can do is to write the prescription here;
 you must take the medicine.

The clock has nothing to do with the length of a sermon.
 Nothing whatever!
 .
 .
 .
 A long sermon is a sermon that seems long.
 .
 .
 .
 And the short sermon is the one that ends while people are still wishing for more.
 It may have lasted only twenty minutes or it may have lasted for an hour and a half.
 If it leaves the people wishing for more,
 they do not know nor care what the clock said about the length of it.
 You cannot tell,
 therefore,
 how long a sermon is by watching the hands of a clock-watch the people.
 See where their hands are.
 If the hands of the men are for the most part in their vest pockets,
 pulling out their watches to note again how long you have been at it,
 this is ominous.
 See where their eyes are!
 See where their minds are,
 then you will know exactly what time of day it is for that particular sermon.
 It may be high time for it to come to an end.

HOW TO CLOSE A TALK
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Would you like to know in what parts of your speech you are most likely to reveal your inexperience or your expertness,
 your inaptitude or your finesse?
 I'll tell you:
 in the opening and the closing.
 There is an old saying in the theater,
 referring,
 of course,
 to actors,
 that goes like this:
 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Standard
The beginning and the ending!
 They are the hardest things in almost any activity to manage adroitly.
 For example,
 at a social function aren't the most trying feats the graceful entrance and the graceful leave-taking?
 In a business interview,
 aren't the most difficult tasks the winning approach and the successful close?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The close,
 is really the most strategic point in a speech;
 what one says last,
 the final words left ringing in the ears when one ceases-these are likely to be remembered longest.
 Beginners,
 however,
 seldom appreciate the importance of this coign of vantage.
 Their endings often leave much to be desired.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What are their most common errors?
 Let us discuss a few and search for remedies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First,
 there is the man who finishes with:
 
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

"
\end_layout

\end_inset

That is about all I have to say on the matter;
 so I guess
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I shall stop.
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

"
\end_layout

\end_inset

 That is not an ending.
 That is a mistake.
 That reeks of the amateur.
 That is almost unpardonable.
 If that is all you have to say,
 why not round off your talk,
 and promptly take your seat and stop without talking about stopping.
 Do that,
 and the inference that that is all you have to say may,
 with safety and good taste,
 be left to the discernment of the audience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then there is the speaker who says all he has to say,
 but he does not know how to stop.
 I believe it was Josh Billings who advised people to take the bull by the tail instead of the horns,
 since it would be easier to let go.
 This speaker has the bull by the frontal extremities,
 and wants to part company with him,
 but try as hard as he will,
 he can't get near a friendly fence or tree.
 So he finally thrashes about in a circle,
 covering the same ground,
 repeating himself,
 leaving a bad impression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remedy?
 An ending has to be planned some time,
 doesn't it?
 Is it the part of wisdom to try to do it after you are facing an audience,
 while you are under the strain and stress of talking,
 while your mind must be intent on what you are saying?
 Or does common sense suggest the advisability of doing it quietly,
 calmly,
 beforehand?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even such accomplished speakers as Webster,
 Bright,
 Gladstone,
 with their admirable command of the English language,
 felt it necessary to write down and all but memorize the exact words of their closings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The beginner,
 if he follows in their footsteps,
 will seldom have cause to regret it.
 He ought to know very definitely with what ideas he is going
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 to close.
 He ought to rehearse the ending several times,
 using not necessarily the same phraseology during each repetition,
 but putting the thoughts definitely into words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An extemporaneous talk,
 during the process of delivery,
 sometimes has to be altered very materially,
 has to be cut and slashed to meet unforeseen developments,
 to harmonize with the reactions of one's hearers;
 so it is really wise to have two or three closings planned.
 If one does not fit,
 another may.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some speakers never get to the end at all.
 Along in the middle of their journey,
 they begin to sputter and misfire like an engine when the gasoline supply is about exhausted;
 after a few desperate lunges,
 they come to a complete standstill,
 a breakdown.
 They need,
 of course,
 better preparation,
 more prac-tise-more gasoline in the tank.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many novices stop too abruptly.
 Their method of closing lacks smoothness,
 lacks finish.
 Properly speaking,
 they have no close;
 they merely cease suddenly,
 jerkily.
 The effect is unpleasant,
 amateurish.
 It is as if a friend in a social conversation were to break off brusquely and dart out of the room without a graceful leave-taking.

No less a speaker than Lincoln made that mistake in the original draft of his First Inaugural.
 That speech was delivered at a tense time.

He submitted his speech to Secretary Seward.
 Seward quite appropriately pointed out that the ending was too blunt,
 too abrupt,
 too provocative.
 So Seward himself tried his hand at a closing;
 in fact,
 he wrote two.
 Lincoln accepted one of them and used it,
 with slight modifications,
 in place of the last three sentences of the close he had originally prepared.
 The result was that his First Inaugural Address now lost its provocative abruptness and rose to a climax of friendliness,
 of sheer beauty and poetical eloquence:

 to see her lift once more as in our fathers' days,
 a clear standard against the paganism of this present world and,
 refusing to hold her conscience at the beck and call of belligerent states,

One would hardly expect Lloyd George to leave a gathering of Methodists laughing when he was talking to them on the ultra-solemn subject of John Wesley's Tomb;

 Note,

I am glad you have taker in hand the repair of his tomb.
 It should be honored.
 He was a man who had a special abhorrence of any absence of neatness or cleanliness.
 He it was,
 I think,
 who said,
 'let no one ever see a ragged Methodist.' It is due to him that you never can see one.
 (Laughter.) It is a double unkindness to leave his tomb ragged.
 You remember what he said to a Derbyshire girl who ran to the door as he was passing and cried,
 'God
\begin_inset Newline newline

 bless you,
 Mr.
 Wesley.' 'Young woman,' he answered,
 'your blessing would be of more value if your face and apron were cleaner.' (Laughter.) That was his feeling about untidiness.
 Do not leave his grave untidy.
 If he passed along,
 that would hurt him more than anything:
 Do look after that.
 It is a memorable and sacred shrine It is your trust.

Of all methods of ending,
 none are more acceptable,

If we insist to the letter upon our claim,
 our claim will in all probability never be met.
 If we insist upon it selfishly,
 we realize in hatreds but not in cash.
 If we are generous,
 and wisely generous,
 those claims can all be paid,
 and the good we do with them will mean more to us materially than anything we would conceivably be parting with.

The climax is a popular way of ending.
 It is often difficult to manage and is not an ending for

 But,
 when wull done,
 it is excellent.
 It works up to a crest,

It calls up the indefinite past.
 When Columbus first sought this continent-when Christ suffered on the crosswhen Moses led Israel through the Red Sea-nay,
 even when Adam first came from the hands of his Maker;
 then,
 as now,
 Niagara was roaring here.
 The eyes of that species of extinct giants whose bones fill the mounds of America have gazed on Niagara,
 as ours do now.
 Contemporary with the first race of men,
 and older than the first man,
 Niagara is as strong and fresh to-day as ten thousand years ago.
 The Mammoth and Mastodon,
 so long dead that fragments of their monstrous bones alone testify that they ever lived,
 have gazed on Niagara-in that long,
 long time never still for a moment,
 never dried,
 never frozen,
 never slept,
 never rested.

 Rule:
 When a pronoun is the direct object of a verb,
 it is always in the objective case.
 In other words,
 if the verb in the sentence denotes an action that passes over to or affects the pronoun,
 then the pronoun must be in the objective case.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right:

 Wrong:

VOICE EXERCISE-DEVELOPING RESONANCE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The three fundamental principles of good tone production are correct breath control,
 relaxation and resonance.
 We have already dealt with the first two principles;
 now for the third:
 resonance.
 What is it that strengthens and beautifies the tone of your radio or victrola?
 The horn or loud speaker.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your body acts as a sounding board for your voice much in the same way that the body of a violin or piano amplifies and beautifies the tones produced by the musician.
 The initial tone is made by the vocal chords,
 but this rises and reverberates against the hard bony structures of the chest,
 the teeth,
 the roof of the mouth,
 the nasal cavities and other parts of the face.
 This reverberation gives to the voice its most important quality.
 Think of the voice as a sky rocket rising from the diaphragm up through the darkness of your relaxed throat and breaking into a shower of sound against the nostrils and other bony parts of the head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our problem is not to speak with insonance.
 You have been speaking with it all your life.
 You could not be heard ten feet without it.

 Humming,

 will develop the resonance of the voice.
 The humming or most people sounds like a caterwaul because the jaw,
 the lips,
 the tongue and the vocal membranes are all painfully rigid.
 Of course,
 the vocal organs should be in the same position for humming as for good tone production:
 there should be complete relaxation of the facial muscles,
 the jaw,
 and the tongue,
 just as they are kept when in a state of repose or while sleeping;
 the lips are to be lightly united.
 Thus the tone vibrations will neither be deadened by obstructing muscles nor forced through the nose by the strain;
 instead they will resonate within the nasal cavities and make the notes round and beautiful.

\begin_layout Standard
The first time you ham this,
 put the palm of your hand on top of your head and feel the vibration there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is most important:
 in practising all these exercises for resonance,
 let your first step be the taking of a deep breath at the diaphragm and relaxing the chest and feeling it riding on the breath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note the open feeling that you have in your face and nose and head as you drink the air in.
 As you begin to hum and exhale,
 do not think of exhaling at all.
 Imagine that you are still inhaling,
 still feeling that open sensation in the head.
 That means open cavities to reënforce and amplify your resonance.
 Cultivate this inhaling sensation in all your speaking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now hum this song once more.
 Place your hand this time on the back of your head and feel the vibration there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A third time,
 think the tone in your nose.
 Feel as if it were flowing up and into the nose-the same sensation as in inhaling.
 Hold the bony part of your nose,
 just a little below the eyes,
 with a thumb and a forefinger.
 Feel the vibration there this time as you hum.

 My best training came from him.
 He was intolerant of vagueness,

 when he was eighty-one years old,
 I carried everything I wrote to him.
 He would make me read it aloud,
 which was always painful to me.
 Every now and then he would stop me.
 'What do you mean by that?' I would tell him,
 and,
 of course,
 in doing so would express myself more simply than I had on paper.

A famous English bishop,

 I questioned them.

 Why,
 the half of those negroes did not know whether Servia was a town or a disease.
 He might as well,
 as far as results were concerned,
 have delivered a sonorous eulogy on the Nebular Hypothesis.
 However,
 not a single trooper left the hall while he was speaking:
 the military police with revolvers were stationed at every exit to prevent that consummation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I do not wish to belittle the bishop.
 He is every inch a scholar;
 and before a body of collegiate men he would probably have been powerful;
 but he failed with these negroes,
 and he failed utterly:
 he did not know his audience,
 and he evidently knew neither the precise purpose of his talk nor how to accomplish it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 2.
 To impress and convince.

 3.
 To get action.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 4.
 To entertain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us illustrate these by a series of concrete examples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lincoln,
 who was always more or less interested in mechanics,
 once invented and patented a device for lifting stranded boats off sand bars and other obstructions.
 He worked in a mechanic's shop near his law office,
 making a model of his apparatus.
 Although the device finally came to naught,
 he was decidedly enthusiastic over its possibilities.
 When friends came to his office to view the model,
 he took no end of pains to explain it.
 The main purpose of those explanations was clearness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he delivered his immortal oration at Gettysburg,
 when he gave his first and second inaugural addresses,
 when Henry Clay died and Lincoln delivered an eulogy on his life-on all these occasions,
 Lincoln's main purpose was impressiveness and conviction.
 He had to be clear,
 of course,
 before he could be convincing;
 but,
 in these instances,
 clearness was not his major consideration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In his talks to juries,
 he tried to win favorable decisions.
 In his political talks,
 he tried to win votes.
 His purpose,
 then,
 was action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two years before he was elected President,
 Lincoln prepared a lecture on Inventions.
 His pur-
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 pose was entertainment.
 At least,
 that should have been his goal;
 but he was evidently not very successful in attaining it.
 His career as a popular lecturer was,
 in fact,
 a distinct disappointment.
 In one town,
 not a person came to hear him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But he did succeed and he succeeded famously in the other speeches of his that I have referred to.
 And why?
 Because,
 in those instances,
 he knew his goal,
 and he knew how to achieve it.
 He knew where he wanted to go and how to get there.
 And because so many speakers don't know just that,
 they often flounder and come to grief.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example:
 I once saw a United States Congressman hooted and hissed and forced to leave the stage of the old New York Hippodrome,
 because he had-unconsciously,
 no doubt,
 but nevertheless,
 unwisely-chosen clearness as his goal.
 It was during the war.
 He talked to his audience about how the United States was preparing.
 The crowd did not want to be instructed.
 They wanted to be entertained.
 They listened to him patiently,
 politely,
 for ten minutes,
 a quarter of an hour,
 hoping the performance would come to a rapid end.
 But it didn't.
 He rambled on and on;
 patience snapped;
 the audience would not stand for more.
 Someone began to cheer ironically.
 Others took it up.
 In a moment,
 a thousand people were whistling and shouting.
 The speaker,
 obtuse and incapable as he was of sensing the temper of his audience,
 had the bad taste to continue.
 That aroused them.
 A battle was on.
 Their impatience mounted to ire.
 They determined to silence him.
 Louder and louder grew their storm of protest.
 Finally,
 the roar of it,
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 the anger of it drowned his words-he could not have been heard twenty feet away.
 So he was forced to give up,

 I could not sleep,

 when I got on such a hunt after an idea,
 until I had caught it,
 and when I thought I had got it I was not satisfied until I had repeated it over and over,

RESTATE YOUR iMPORTANT IDEAS IN DIFFERENT WORDS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Napoleon declared repetition to be the only serious principle of rhetoric.
 He knew that because an idea was clear to him was not always proof that it was instantly grasped by others.
 He knew that it takes time to comprehend new ideas,
 that the mind must be kept focussed on them.
 In short,
 he knew they must be repeated.
 Not in exactly the same language.
 People will rebel at that,
 and rightly so.
 But if the repetition is couched in fresh phraseology,
 if it is varied,
 your hearers will never regard it as repetition at all.

 It may cause the country doctor in the Ozark Mountains to think of a family doctor in a small city with an income of five thousand.
 It may cause a successful mining engineer to think in terms of the men in his profession who make a hundred thousand a year.

DO NOT EMULATE THE MOUNTAIN GOAT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor William James,
 in one of his talks to ceachers,
 pauses to remark that one can make only one point in a lecture,
 and the lecture he referred to lasted an hour.
 Yet I recently heard a speaker,
 who was limited by a stop watch to three minutes,
 begin by saying that he wanted to call our attention to eleven points.
 Sixteen and a half seconds to each phase of his subject!
 Seems incredible,
 doesn't it,
 that an intelligent man should attempt anything so manifestly absurd.
 True,
 I am quoting an extreme case;
 but the tendency to err in that fashion,
 if not to that degree,
 handicaps almost every novice.
 He is like a Cook's guide who shows Paris to the tourist in one day.
 It can be done,
 just as one can walk through the American Museum of Natural History in thirty minutes.
 But neither clearness nor enjoyment results.
 Many a talk fails to be clear because the speaker seems intent upon establishing a world's record for ground covered in the allotted time.
 He leaps from one point to another with the swiftness and agility of a mountain goat.

The talks in this course must,
 owing to the pressure of time,
 be short;

 If,

 you are to speak on Labor Unions,
 do not attempt to tell us in three or six minutes why they came into existence,
 the methods they employ,
 the good they have accomplished,
 the evil they have wrought,
 and how to solve industrial disputes.
 No,
 no;
 if you strive to do that,
 no one will have a very clear conception of what
\begin_inset Newline newline

 you have said.
 It will be all confused,
 a blur,
 too sketchy,
 too much of a mere outline.

Wouldn't it be the part of wisdom to take one phase and one phase only of labor unions,

VOICE EXERCISE-DEVELOPING RESONANCE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following discussion of resonance and exercises for its development were written especially for this course by Professor R.
 J.
 Hughes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Do you remember,
 when you were a boy,
 how,
 when you stuck your head into the half-empty rain barrel,
 and uttered a sound,
 the wonderful effect produced fairly made your ears ring?
 That effect was due to resonance or sympathetic vibration.
 The sound you produced was magnified many times by being communicated to the air partially inclosed in the upper part of the barrel.
 All musical instruments,
 the drum with its barrel,
 the horn with its tube and bell,
 the piano with its sounding-board,
 the violin with its body of seasoned wood,
 all these are constructed on the principle that a comparatively weak initial sound can be reinforced and multiplied in power by communicaing itself to a suitable elastic medium whether it be air,
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 wood,
 or metal.
 The human voice is such a musical instrument.
 The feeble buzzing of the vocal cords is the initial sound which sets in vibration the chest and the partially open air cavities of the pharynx,
 mouth,
 and nose where it is wonderfully re-entorced and gains greatly in power and grandeur.
 If we heard only the initial buzz of the vocal cords,
 a voice would be heard only a few feet away and would have none of the characteristics we associate with human speech.
 The resonance of the chest is largely automatic while that of the cavities of the head is under the control of the will and by skillful use can be made to produce both beautiful and powerful effects.
 A speaker of my acquaintance who used to have a singularly toneless and empty voice has by careful study and faithful practice gained full use of his head resonance and now for some years has been noted for the ringing quality of his voice and for his ability to fill large auditoriums with ease.
 Instruction in the proper use of your resonators,
 especially the mouth and the nose,
 must be an important part of your education as a public speaker.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taking the vibrating air as it leaves the larynx or voicebox,
 we follow it up through the open throat until it reaches the veil of the soft palate which you can see hanging at the back of the mouth.
 Under its arch a part of the breath stream enters the mouth and another part rises through the passageway back of this veil or curtain into the nose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of these two cavities the nose is the larger and has as irregular and varied a surface as the interior of a rocky cavern.
 Have you ever talked loudly or hallooed in a cave?
 Reverberations such as you never heard before greeted your astonished ears.
 In a similar way brilliant and tich qualities are added to your voice in the queer-shaped cavernous spaces of your nose and head.
 This is called 
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

"
\end_layout

\end_inset

head resonance.
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

"
\end_layout

\end_inset

 At the same time the other stream,
 which entered the mouth under the arch of the palate,
 is undergoing an entirely different change.
 Besides being reenforced in volume just as was the stream that entered the nasal cavity by the rear door,
 this second breath stream is modified by the shape given to the interior of the mouth
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 by the plastic tongue and mobile lips.
 These mouth modifications of the feeble initial tone are called vowels.
 Thus we learn that vowels are merely mouth resonances,
 not made at all by the vocal cords.
 At the larynx all vowels are the same.
 The mold temporarily given to the inside of the mouth,
 largely by the tongue,
 determines what vowel shall come out.
 Thus the mouth is the vowel chamber,
 where also the interferences called consonants are made.
 We will now show you how to use the three resonating cavities most effectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The chest cavity resounds automatically when you support your tone firmly on your controlled breath,
 as you learned in Chapter V.
 You can feel it when you place your hand upon your upper chest.
 It is stronger on the deeper tones of low pitch;
 but can be felt throughout the speaking range of the adult male voice.
 Support your voice with your deep breath on every word uttered and you will get full aid from your chest resonance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for your nasal resonance,
 this valuable aid can only be obtained by special training.
 At the very outset we must know the difference between nasal resonance and nasal

\begin_layout Standard
Exercise I.
 Inhale deeply.
 Gradually expel the breath with a soft hissing sound forming the consonants.
 Repeat,
 and while hissing,
 suddenly close the lips without stopping the steady flow of breath which will now pass through the nose,
 making the humming consonant 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Exercise 2.
 Inhale deeply.
 Hum 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
 Then without stopping the hum change it to 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 by opening the lips and lifting the tip of the tongue to the hard palate.
 Alternate 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 repeatedly,
 keeping up a continuous stream of resonance,
 sounding like

Exercise 3.
 Vary Exercise 2 by introducing the vowel sound 
\begin_inset Formula $ee$
\end_inset

 between the hums and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

;
 thus,
 menemene,
 etc.
 Notice the clear resonance of the vowel in the front of the mouth-chamber while the hum still continues in the nose without interruption.
 This humming sound during the utterance of the vowel is important.
 Feel it as well as hear it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Exercise 4.
 Repeat Exercise 3,
 then without stopping the stream of resonance,
 change ee into ah,
 forming mene ah,
 which will give a clear ringing 
\begin_inset Formula $ah$

 member it is more productive to stir emotions than to arouse thoughts.
 Feelings are more powerful than cold ideas.
 To arouse feelings one must be intensely in earnest.
 Insincerity rips the vitals out of delivery.
 Regardless of the pretty phrases a man may concoct;
 regardless of the illustrations he may assemble;
 regardless of the harmony of his voice,
 and the grace of his gestures:
 if he does not speak sincerely,
 these are hollow and glittering trappings.
 If you would impress an audience,
 be impressed yourself.

 radiating through your voice,

 What would have happened?
 Doubtlessly a verbal joust -a wordy war would have ensued,
 as futile as it was fiery.
 The atheist would have risen with an unholy zeal upon him to fight with all the fury of a Fuzzy Wuzzy for his opinions.
 Why?
 Because,
 as Professor Robinson has pointed out,
 they were his opinions,
 and his precious,
 indispensable self-esteem would have been threatened;
 his pride would have been at stake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since pride is such a fundamentally explosive characteristic of human nature,
 wouldn't it be the part of wisdom to get a man's pride working for us,
 instead of against us?
 How?
 By showing,
 as Paley did,
 that the thing we propose is very similar to something that our opponent already believes.
 That renders it easier for him to accept than to reject your proposal.
 That prevents contradictory and opposing ideas from arising in the mind to vitiate what we have said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Paley showed delicate appreciation of how the human mind functions.
 Most men,
 however,
 lack this subtle ability to enter the citadel of a man's beliefs arm in arm with the owner.
 They erroneously imagine that in order to take the citadel,
 they must storm it,
 batter it down by a frontal attack.
 What happens?
 The moment hostilities commence,
 the drawbridge is lifted,
 the great gates are slammed and bolted,
 the mailed archers draw their long bows-the battle of words and wounds is on.
 Such frays always end in a draw;
 neither has convinced the other of anything.

 Our problem then,
 when the purpose of our talk is impressiveness and conviction,
 is twofold:
 first,
 to set forth our own ideas;
 second,
 to prevent opposing ideas from arising to render them null and void.
 Here are eight suggestions that will aid in achieving that consummation:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 I.
 Convince yourself before you attempt to convince others.
 Speak with contagious enthusiasm.
\begin_inset Newline newline

 2.
 Show how the thing you want people to accept is very similar to something they already believe.

ERRORS IN ENGLISH
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As Chapter XII contained a thorough review,
 this chapter will start right off with some new examples of English as it should be spoken.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rule:
 When two or more pronouns are united by 
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

"
\end_layout

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 and governed by the same preposition or verb,
 they must both be in the same case.
 Many a speaker blunders here.
 You will note that the same matter is discussed as was taken up in Chapter XI,
 where the rule stated that,
 when a pronoun is a direct object of a verb,
 it is always in the objective case.
 Here we have added examples where pronouns are objects of prepositions.
 Examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right:
 Between you and me.
\begin_inset Newline newline

 Wrong:
 Between you and

VOICE EXERCISE-NASAL RESONANCE

 sound,
 making it ring through his nose to develop nasal resonance.
 Nasal resonance gives both brightness and carrying power;
 and is highly desirable when one is speaking at a distance.

Practise the exercise that Roosevelt used.
 Then read aloud,
 not once,
 but once a day,
 the following verse from Poe's The Bells.
 I am asking you to read these for the following reasons.

\begin_layout Enumerate
Practise it for nasal resonance.
 Let the sound of bells,
 bells,
 bells ring through the cavern of your nose,
 and,
 in fact,
 through all the irregular cavities of your head.
 As we have pointed out in previous chapters,
 breathe in deeply and then try to feel while you are reading and using breath that same open feeling in the head that you experienced when inhaling.

\begin_layout Enumerate
Read this also as an exercise for developing strength and agility in the tip of your tongue.
 The

 so frequent in these verses,
 are almost ideal for that purpose.
 To refresh your mind on this exercise,

Always have something to say.
 The man who has something to say,
 and who is known never to speak unless he has,
 is sure to be listened to.
 Always know before what you mean to say.
 If your own mind is muddled,
 much more will the minds of your hearers be confused.
 Always arrange your thoughts in some sort of order.
 No matter.
 how brief they are to be,
 they will be better for having a beginning,
 a middle,
 and an end.
 At all hazards,
 be clear.
 Make your meaning,
 whatever it is,
 plain to your audience.
 In controversial speaking,
 aim to anticipate your adversary's argument.
 Reply to his jests seriously and to his earnestness by jest.
 Always reflect before hand upon the kind of audience you are likely to have.

If you were invited to dine at the home of a rich man in certain sections of China,
 it would be proper to toss chicken bones and olive seeds over your shoulder onto the floor.
 You pay your host a complia ment when you do that.
 You show that you realize that he is wealthy,
 that he has plenty of servants to tidy up after the meal.
 And he likes it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can be reckless with the remains of your sumptuous meal in a rich man's home;
 but in some parts of China the poorer people must save even the water they bathe in.
 To heat water costs so much that they must buy it at a hot water shop.
 After they have bathed in it,
 they can take it back and sell it second hand to the shopkeeper from whom they purchased it.
 When the second customer has soiled it,
 the water still retains a market value,
 although the price has softened a bit.

Have you found these facts about Chinese life interesting?

Let us take another illustration.
 This page you are reading now,
 this sheet of paper you are looking at-it is very ordinary,
 isn't it?
 You have seen countless thousands of such pages.
 It seems dull and insipid now;
 but if I tell you a strange fact about ii,
 you are almost sure to be interested.
 Let us see!
 This page seems like solid matter as you look at it now.
 But,
 in reality,
 it is more like a cobweb than solid matter.
 The physicist knows it is composed of atoms.
 And how small is an atom?
 We learned in Chapter XII that there are as many atoms in one drop of water as there are drops of water in the Mediterranean sea,
 that there are as many atoms in one drop of water as there are blades of grass in all the world.
 And the atoms that make this paper are composed of what?
 Still smaller things called electrons and protons.
 These electrons are all rotating around the central proton of the atom,
 as far from it,
 relatively speaking,
 as the moon is from the earth.
 And they are swinging through their orbits,
 these electrons of this tiny universe,
 at the inconceivable speed of approxi mately ten thousand miles a second.
 So the elec trons that compose this sheet of paper you are hold ing,
 have moved,
 since you began reading this very sentence,
 a distance equal to that which stretches between New York and Tokio.

 lies one of the secrets of interesting people.
 That is a significant truth,
 one that we ought to profit by in our every day intercourse.
 The entirely new is not interesting;
 the entirely old has no attractiveness for us.
 We want to be told something new about the old.
 You cannot,
 for example,
 interest an Illinois farmer with a description of the Cathedral at Bourges,
 or the Mona Lisa.
 They are too new to him.
 There is no tie-up to his old interests.
 But you can interest him by relating the fact that farmers in Holland till land below the level of the sea and dig ditches to act as fences and build bridges to serve as gates.
 Your Illinois farmer will listen open-mouthed while you tell him that Dutch farmers keep the cows,
 during the winter,
 under the same roof that houses the family,
 and sometimes the cows look out through lace curtains at driving snows.
 He knows about cows and fences-new slants,
 you see,
 on old things.

We all appear to ourselves to be thinking all the time during our waking hours,
 and most of us are aware that
\begin_inset Newline newline

 we go on thinking while we are asleep,
 even more foolishly than when awake.
 When uninterrupted by some practical issue we are engaged in what is now known as a reverie.
 This is our spontaneous and favorite kind of thinking.
 We allow our ideas to take their own course and this course is determined by our hopes and fears,
 our spontaneous desires,
 their fulfillment or frustration;
 by our likes and dislikes,
 our loves and hates and resentments.
 There is nothing else anything like so interesting to ourselves as ourselves.
 All thought that is not more or less laboriously controlled and directed will inevitably circle about the beloved Ego.
 It is amusing and pathetic to observe this tendency in ourselves and in others.
 We learn politely and generously to overlook this truth,
 but if we dare to think of it,
 it blazes forth like the noontide sun.

HOW TO BE A GOOD CONVERSATIONALIST

The reason so many people are poor conversationalists is because they talk about only the things that interest them.

 Reverse the process.

 his success-or,
 if it is a mother,
 her children.
 Do that and listen intently and you will give pleasure;

There was a certain member of that course who invariably found it difficult to interest either himself or his audience.
 This night,
 however,
 he seized the human story suggestion;
 and told us of two of his classmates in college.
 One of them had been so conservative that he had bought shirts at the different stores in town,
 and made charts showing which ones laundered best,
 wore longest and gave the most service per dollar invested.
 His mind was always on pennies;
 yet,
 when he was graduated-it was an engineering college-he had such a high opinion of his own importance that he was not willing to
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 begin at the bottom and work his way up,
 as the other graduates were doing.
 Even when the third annual reunion of the class came,
 he was still making laundry charts of his shirts,
 while waiting for some extraordinarily good thing to come his way.
 It never came.
 A quarter of a century has passed since then,
 and this man,
 dissatisfied and soured on life,
 still holds a minor position.

The speaker then contrasted with this failure the story of one of his classmates who had surpassed all expectations.
 This particular chap was a good mixer.
 Everyone liked him.
 Although he was ambitious to do big things later,
 he started as a draughtsman.
 But he was always on the lookout for opportunity.
 Plans were then being made for the Pan-American exposition in Buffalo.
 He knew engineering talent would be needed there;
 so he resigned from his position in PhiladeIphia and moved to Buffalo.
 Through his agreeable personality,
 he soon won the friendship of a Buffalo man with considerable political influence.
 The two formed a partnership,
 and engaged immediately in the contracting business.
 They did considerable work for the telephone company,
 and this man was finally taken over by that concern at a large salary.
 To-day he is a multimillionaire,

 The speech kad been so interesting that it seemed short to everyone.
 It was this student's first real triumph.

\begin_layout Standard
Almost every student can profit by this incident.
 The average speech would be far more appealing if it were rich and replete with human interest stories.

If possible,
 these stories ought to tell of struggles,
 of things fought for and victories won.
 All of us are tremendously interested in fights and combats.
 There is an old saying that all the world loves a lover.

 What all the world loves is a scrap.
 It wants to see two lovers struggling for the hand of one woman.
 As an illustration of this fact,
 read almost any novel,
 magazine story,
 or go to see almost any film drama.
 When all the obstacles are removed and the reputed hero takes the so-called heroine in his arms,
 the audience begins reaching for their hats and coats.
 Five minutes later the sweeping women are gossiping over their broom handles.

BE CONCRETE

The writer once had in the same course in public speaking,
 a Doctor of Philosophy and a rough-and-ready fellow who had spent his youth thirty years ago in the British Navy.
 The polished scholar was a university professor;
 his classmate from the seven seas was the proprietor of a small side street moving-van establishment.
 Strange to say,
 the moving-van man's talks during the course would have held a popular audience far better than the talks of the college professor.
 Why?
 The college man spoke in beautiful English,
 with a demeanor of culture and refinement,
 and with logic and clearness;
 but his talks lacked one essential,
 concreteness.
 They were too vague,
 too general.
 On the other hand,
 the van owner possessed hardly enough power of cerebration to generalize.
 When he talked he got right down to business immediately.
 He was definite;
 he was concrete.
 That quality,
 coupled with his virility and his fresh phraseology,
 made his talks very entertaining.

 he never watered the milk and he never traded a horse with the heaves as a sound animal.

We are told that there are some millions of people in poverty and poorly nourished in this country,
 yet here at Niagara is wasted the equivalent of 250,000 loaves of bread an hour.
 We may see with our mind's eye 600,000 nice fresh eggs dropping over the precipice every hour and making a gigantic omelet in the whirlpool.
 If calico were continuously pouring from the looms in a stream 4,000 feet wide like Niagara River,
 it would represent the same destruction of property.
 If a Carnegie Library were held under the spout it would be filled with good books in an hour or two.
 Or we can imagine a big department store floating down from Lake Erie every day and smashing its varied contents on the rocks 160 feet below.
 That would be an exceedingly interesting and diverting spectacle,
 quite as attractive to the crowd as the present,
 and no more expensive to maintain.
 Yet some people might object to that on the ground of extravagance who now object to the utilization of the power of the falling water.

 It is the widest of these terms and applies to the will,
 the intellect and the affections taken conjointly;
 as,
 the whole bent of his character was toward evil practices.
 Bias is literally a weight fixed on one side of a ball used in bowling and causing it to swerve from a straight course.
 Used figuratively,
 bias applies particularly to the judgment,
 and denotes something that acts with a permanent force on the character through that faculty;
 as,
 the bias of early education,
 early habits,
 etc.
 Inclination is an excited state of desire or appetency;
 as,
 a strong inclination to the study of law.
 Prepossession is a mingled state of feeling and opinion in respect to some person or subject which has laid hold of and occupied the mind previous to inquiry.
 The word is commonly used in a good sense,
 an unfavorable impression of this kind being denominated a prejudice.
 'Strong minds will be strongly bent,
 and usually labour under a strong bias;
 but there is no mind so weak and powerless as not to have its inclinations,
 and

 none so guarded to be without its prepossessions.'–Crabb.

 Do not gaze at the floor,

 It destroys a sense of communication,
 a feeling of give and take,

 It also directs the tone toward the floor and interferes with its floating out over the audience.

 Yes,
 or to speak without it.
 It is the powder behind the bullets of your words.
 There should be,
 at all times,
 a reserve of breath in your lungs to act as a spring board,
 a catapult,
 to launch your words.
 You have doubtlessly seen,
 in store windows or in shooting galleries,
 little balls dancing up and down,
 on jets of water.
 Your words should be buoyed up by breath like that.
 They should ride like a kite on a cushion of air.
 So breathe deeply,
 feeling the lower part of the lungs expanding at the lower ribs and pushing down and flattening out the arched diaphragm.
 When you start to speak,
 do not use up all your breath at once.
 Use as little as possible.
 Control it according to the directions given in Chapter V.
\begin_inset Newline newline

 A man pounding with a hammer on a piece of iron will make a disagreeable noise which is all but deafening close at hand;
 but it will not carry.
 But the music of an orchestra or a band can be heard playing for a long distance through a racket and uproar.
 Why the difference?
 That is easy to explain:
 the instruments of the band make pure,
 harmonious sounds,
 sounds with resonance;
 but the hammer striking the iron makes only a dull,
 ugly clangor without resonance.
 Only a few days ago,
 the author stood beside a bugler sounding a call.
 Had the bugler used the same amount of breath
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 in a harsh shout,
 it would not have carried very far;
 but this breath sent into the bugle,
 vibrating in its resonance chambers,
 created sound waves which carried a long,
 long distance.

Now we can understand why some voices that seem very loud to those in the front rows,

 They are the very heart of your words.

 I heard a well known speaker-a man who ought to have known better-introduce the Irish poet,

 Yeats was to read his own poetry.
 Three years prior to that he had been awarded the Nobel prize in literature,
 the highest distinction that can be bestowed upon a man of letters.
 I am confident that not ten per cent of that particular audience knew of either the award or its significance.
 Both ought,
 by all means,
 to have been mentioned.
 They ought to have been announced even if nothing else were said.
 But what did the chairman do?
 He utterly ignored these facts,

 his own importance.

 He will appreciate your suggestions.
 Then tell him the things you would like to have mentioned,
 the things that show why you are in a position to talk about this particular subject,
 the simple facts that the audience ought to know,
 the facts that will win you a hearing.
 Of course,
 after being told only once,
 the chairman is going to forget half of them and get the other half all mixed up;
 so it is a good plan to hand them to him,
 just a sentence or two,
 typewritten,
 hoping that he will refresh his mind before he introduces you.
 But will he?
 Probably not.

 Here is the way the late John H.

 handled a situation of that kind.
 We are quoting from his article in System Magazine:

It became necessary to raise the prices of our cash registers.
 The agents and sales managers protested;
 they said

\end_layout

\end_inset

 that our business would go,
 that prices had to be kept where they were.
 I called them all in to Dayton and we had a meeting.
 I staged the affair.
 Back of me on the platform I had a great sheet of paper and a sign painter.
\begin_inset Newline newline

I asked the people to state their objections to the increasing of prices.
 The objections came ripping out from the audience like shots from a machine gun.
 As fast as they came,
 I had the sign man post them on the big sheet.
 We spent all of the first day gathering objections.
 I did nothing but exhort.
 When the meeting closed we had a list of at least a hundred different reasons why the prices should not be raised.
 Every possible reason was up there before the men,
 and it seemed conclusively settled in the minds of the audience that no change should be made.
 Then the meeting adjourned.

 No loose ends were left.
 We settled everything on the spot.

But in a case such as this one it would not have been enough,
 in my mind,
 merely to have settled the point in dispute.
 A meeting of agents should break up with all of the audience filled with a new lot of enthusiasm;
 perhaps the points of the register itself might have been a little blurred in the discussion.
 That would never do.
 We had to have a dramatic climax.
 I had arranged for that and just before the close of the conference,
 I had a hundred men march,
 one by one,
 across the stage;
 each bore a banner and on that banner was a picture of a part of the latest register and just what it did.
 Then when the last man passed across,
 they all came back into a kind of grand finale-the complete machine.
 The meeting ended with the agents on their feet and cheering wildly!

Everything that ever has happened or ever will happen has been,

 the logical and inevitable effect of something that preceded it,
 the logical and inevitable cause of something that follows.
 This principle,

 changeth not.
 It is as true of earthquakes and Joseph's coat of many colors,
 and the honking of wild geese and jealousy and the price of baked beans,

 The things that actuate us are not many.
 We are ruled hour by hour,

\begin_inset Newline newline

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All that means just this:
 if one knows what these motives are and can appeal to them with sufficient force,
 he will have extraordinary power.
 The wise speaker attempts to do precisely that.
 But the blunderer gropes his way blindly and to no purpose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example,
 a father finds that his young son has been smoking cigarettes surreptitiously.
 He grows irate,
 fumes,
 scolds,
 commands the boy to have done with the pernicious habit,
 warns him that it will ruin his health.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But suppose that the boy is not concerned about his health,
 that he loves the flavor and adventure of smoking a cigarette more than he fears physical consequences.
 What will happen?
 The father's appeal will prove futile.
 Why?
 Because the parent was not shrewd enough to play upon a motive that touched his son.
 The parent played only on the motives that actuated himself.
 He did not get over on the boy's side of the fence at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However,
 it is quite probable that that boy longs with all his heart to make the track team at school,
 to compete for the hundred yard dash,
 to excel at athletics.
 So if the father will only cease unloading his own feelings,
 and show his son that smoking is going to impede and interfere with his cherished athletic ambitions,
 the father will probably get the desired action,
 get it smoothly and completely,
 and get it by the eminently sensible process of putting a stronger desire against a weaker one.
 This is precisely what does happen in one of the biggest sporting events in the world-the Oxford-Cam-

 The oarsmen deny themselves the use of tobacco all during their training.
 Compared to the winning of the race,

One of the most serious problems that mankind faces to-day is the battle with insects.
 A few years ago,
 the Oriental fruit moth was imported into this country on some cherry trees which were forwarded at the instance of the Japanese government and were used to ornament the borders of a lake at our national capital.
 This moth spread and threatened the fruit crop of some of the eastern states.
 Spraying seemed to have no effect,
 so finally,
 the government was obliged to import another insect from Japan,
 and turn it loose here to prey upon this moth.
 So our agricultural experts are fighting one pest with another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man skilled in getting action employs similar tactics.
 He sets one motive to war against another.
 This method is so sensible,
 so simple,
 so utterly apparent that one might imagine that the use of it was all but universal.
 Far from it.
 One often sees exhibitions that make him inclined to suspect that the use of it is very rare.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To cite a concrete case:
 the writer recently attended a noonday luncheon club in a certain city.
 A golf party was being organized to play over the country club course of a neighboring city.
 Only a few members had put down their names.
 The president of the club was displeased;
 something he was behind was about to fall;
 his prestige was at stake.
 So he made what he imagined was an appeal for more members to go.
 His talk was woefully in-
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 adequate;
 he based his urge very largely on the fact that he wanted them to go.
 That was no appeal at all.
 .He was not handling human nature skillfully;
 he was merely unloading his own feelings.
 Like the irate father with the cigarette-smoking son,
 he neglected entirely to talk in terms of the desires of his hearers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What should he have done?
 He should have used a generous supply of common sense;
 he should have had a little quiet talk with himself before he spoke to the others;
 and he should have addressed himself somewhat in this fashion:

Why aren't more of these men going on this golfing party?

 How can I overcome these objections?
 I will show them that recreation is not lost time,
 that grinds are not the most successful men,
 that one can do more in five days when he is fresh than he can in six when his batteries need recharging.
 Of course,
 they know this already;
 but they need to be reminded of it.
 I will play up things that they ought to want more than they want to save the small expense connected with this party.
 I will show them that it is an investment in health and pleasure.
 I will stir their imaginations,
 make them see themselves out on the course,
 the west wind in their faces,
 the green sward under their feet,
 feeling sorry for those back in the hot city who live for nothing but money.

 Is it necessary to discourse further upon the potency of this wellknown urge?

And even stronger than the money motive is the desire for self-protection.
 All health appeals are based on that.

 when a patent medicine vendot enumerates all the ills that his nostrums will allevi.

Pride,
 what crimes have been committed in thy name!
 For many years thousands and thousands of young girls suffered excruciating pains in China,
 screamed with it and did it willingly because the dictates of pride said that their feet must be bound and not allowed to grow.

 thousands of native women in certain parts of Central Africa are wearing wooden discs in their lips.
 Incredible as it may seem,
 these discs are as large as the plate on which you ate breakfast this morning.
 When the little girls in these tribes reach eight years of age,
 a slit is made in the outer portion of their lips and a disc is inserted.
 As the seasons pass,
 one disc is replaced by another progressively larger.

 in order that they may appear beautiful,
 in order that they may be admired,
 in order that they may stand high in their own estimation,
 in order that their pride may be appeased.

RELIGIOUS MOTIVES
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is another powerful group of motives that influence us mightily.
 Shall we call them religious motives?
 I mean religious,
 not in the sense of orthodox worship or the tenets of any particular creed or sect.
 I mean rather that broad group of beautiful and eternal truths that Christ taught:
 justice and forgiveness and mercy,
 serving others and loving our neighbors as ourselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No man likes to admit,
 even to himself,
 that he is not good and kind and magnanimous.
 So we love to be appealed to on these grounds.
 It implies a certain nobleness of soul.
 We take pride in that.

For a great many years,
 C.
 S.
 Ward was a secretáry of the International Committee of the Y.
 M.
 C.
 A.,
 devoting all of his time to conducting campaigns to raise funds for Association buildings.
 It does not mean self-preservation or an increase of property or power for a man to write a check for a thousand dollars to the local Y.
 M.
 C.
 A.;
 but many men will do it out of a desire to be noble and just and helpful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Setting up a campaign in a northwestern city,
 Mr.
 Ward approached a well-known business executive who had never been identified with the church or with social movements.
 What?
 Was he expected to neglect his business for a week to raise funds for a Y.

 building?
 The idea was preposterous.
 He finally consented to come to the opening meeting of the campaign;
 and was so moved there by Mr.
 Ward's appeal to his noble-

 ness and altruism that he devoted an entire week to an enthusiastic money-raising campaign.
 Before the week was over,
 this man who had been noted for his constant use of profanity,
 was praying for the success of the undertaking.

A group of men once called upon the late James J.
 Hill to persuade him to establish Y.
 M.
 C.
 A.'s along his railroad lines in the Northwest.
 Money was required,
 a considerable outlay of it;
 and,
 knowing Hill to be a shrewd business man they unwisely based their principal arguments upon his desire for gain.
 These Associations,
 they pointed out,
 would make for happy,
 contented workmen,
 and would enhance the value of his property.

A long-standing dispute over some frontier territory had,
 in 1900,
 brought Argentine and Chile to the brink of war.
 Battleships had been built,
 armaments amassed,
 taxes increased,
 and costly preparations made to settle the issue by blood.
 On Easter day,
 1900 ,
 an Argentine bishop made a passionate appeal for peace in the name of Christ.
 Across the Andes,
 the Chilean bishop reëchoed the message.
 The bishops went from village to village appealing for peace and brotherly love.
 At first,
 their audiences were only women;
 but finally this appeal stirred the entire nations.
 Popular petitions and public opinion forced the governments to arbitrate and to reduce their armies and navies.
 The frontier fortresses were dismantled,
 and the guns
\begin_inset Newline newline

 melted and cast into a huge bronze figure of Christ.
 To-day high in the lofty Andes,
 guarding the disputed frontiers,
 towers this statue of the Prince of Peace holding the cross.
 On the pedestal is written:

SUMMARY
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So much for the method we have been discussing.
 First,
 get interested attention.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 Second,
 win confidence by deserving it,
 by your sincerity,
 by being properly introduced,
 by being qualified to speak on your subject,
 by telling the things that your experience has taught you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third,
 state your facts,
 educate your audience regarding the merits of your proposal,
 answer their objections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fourth,
 appeal to the motives that make men act:
 the desire for gain,
 self-protection,
 
\begin_inset Formula $^{\text{s }}$
\end_inset

 pride,
 pleasures,
 sentiments,
 affections,
 and religious ideals,
 such as justice,
 mercy,
 forgiveness,
 love.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This method,
 if used wisely,
 will not only help the speaker in public;
 it will help him also in private.
 It will help him in the writing of sales letters,
 in constructing advertisements,
 in managing business interviews.

CORRECT USAGE OF WORDS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A skillful'man has profited both from knowledge and practise,
 as a skillful physician.
 Dexter means pertaining to the right hand.
 Dexterous implies habitual ease and sureness,
 such as we have in our right hands.
 Adroit is very close to dexterous in meaning,
 but it also implies the ability to make quick,
 sure movements,
 either mental or physical.
 Apt means especially qualified,
 but it is not so strong a term as expert.
 Sharp denotes a keen intelligence and a quick,
 nice discrimination.
 The
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 proficient man has gone forward and made considerable progress.
 Competent is often used to indicate the general,
 natural ability that fits one to perform a task.
 Qualified commonly refers to specific training.
 A competent musician might,
 with study and practise,
 qualify for a position with the Philharmonic Orchestra.
 Initiated refers to instructions in the beginnings and rudiments.
 It is derived from the same source as the word initial.
 A man who is initiated in the problems of finance may not be qualified to handle the financial affairs of a large corporation.

 Paul Gibbons,
 a well known business man of that city,
 and asked for an interview.
 Mr.
 Gibbons looked at the stranger distrustfully.
 His appearance was emphatically against him.
 His clothes were shabby and threadbare,
 and over all of him were written large the unmistakable signs of financial distress.
 Half out of curiosity,
 half out of pity,
 Mr.
 Gibbons granted the interview.
 At first,
 he had intended to listen for only a moment,
 but the moments grew into minutes,
 and the minutes mounted into an hour;
 and the conversation still continued.
 It ended by Mr.
 Gibbons telephoning to Mr.
 Roland Taylor,
 the Philadelphia manager for Dillon,
 Read and Company;
 and Mr.
 Taylor,
 one of the leading financiers of that city,
 invited this stranger to lunch and secured for him a desirable position.
 How was this man,
 with the air and outward appearance of failure,
 able to effect such a prized connection within so short a time?

 He was,

 an Oxford man who had come to this country on a business mission which had ended in disaster,
 leaving him stranded,

 Yet many a man blunders through a long life time,
 after he leaves school,
 without any conscious effort to enrich his stock of words,
 to master their shades of meaning,
 to speak with precision and distinction.
 He comes habitually to use the overworked and exhausted phrases of the office and street.
 Small wonder that his talk lacks distinction and individuality.
 Small wonder that he often violates the accepted traditions of pronunciation,
 and that he sometimes transgresses the very canons of English grammar itself.

 when he arose,
 he had polished his shoes and put on spotless linen in order to maintain his own selfrespect and to win the respect of those with whom he came in contact;
 but he had made no attempt whatever to polish his phrases and to speak spotless sentences.
 He would have been ashamed,
 for example,
 of not raising his hat to a woman when he spoke;
 but he was not ashamed-no,
 he was not even conscious-of violating the usages of grammar,

 He wrote a lecture on Burns.
 He had one copy of Byron's poems for his office and another for his home.
 The office copy had been used so much that it fell open,
 whenever it was lifted,
 to Don Juan.
 Even when he was in the White House and the tragic burdens of the Civil War were sapping his strength and etching deep furrows in his face,
 he often found time to take a copy of Hood's poems to bed.
 Sometimes he awoke in the middle of the night and,
 opening the book,
 he chanced upon verses that especially stirred or pleased.
 Getting up,
 clad only in his night shirt and slippers,
 he stole through the halls until he found his secretary and read to him poem after poem.
 In the White House,
 he found time to repeat long,
 memorized passages from Shakespeare,
 to criticize the actor's reading of them,
 to give his own individual interpretation.

 'Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation,
 conceived in liberty,
 and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
 Now we are engaged in a great civil war,
 testing whether that nation,
 or any nation so conceived and so dedicated,
 can long endure.
 We are met on a great battle-field of that war.
 We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.
 It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
 But in'a larger sense we cannot dedicate,
 we cannot consecrate,
 we cannot hallow this ground.
 The brave men,
 living and dead,
 who struggled here,
 have consecrated it,
 far above our poor power to add or detract.
 The world will little note,
 nor long remember,
 what we say here,
 but it can never forget what they did here.
 It is for us,
 the living,
 rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.
 It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us,
 that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion;
 that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain;
 that this nation,
 under God,
 shall have a new birth of freedom;
 and that government of the people,
 by the people,

Speak your latent conviction,
 and it shall be the universal sense;
 for always the inmost becomes the outmost,-and our first thought is rendered back to us by the trumpets of the Last Judgment.
 Familiar as the voice of the mind is to each,
 the highest merit we ascribe to Moses,
 Plato,
 and Milton,
 is that they set at naught books and traditions,
 and spoke not what men said but what they thought.
 A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within,
 more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages.
 Yet he dismisses without notice his thought,
 because it is his.
 In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts:
 they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.
 Great works of art have no more affecting lesson for us than this.
 They teach us to abide by our spontaneous impression with goodhumoured inflexibility then most when the whole cry of voices is on the other side.
 Else,
 to-morrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time,
 and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another.

There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance;
 that imitation is suicide;
 that he must take himself for better,
 for worse,
 as his portion;
 that though the wide universe is full of good,
 no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till.
 The power which resides in him is new in nature,
 and none but he knows what that is which he can do,
 nor does he know until he has tried.

THE SECRET OF MARK TWAIN'S WAY WITH WORDS

How did Mark Twain develop his delightful facility with words?
 As a young man,
 he traveled all the way from Missouri to Nevada by the ponderously slow and really painful stage coach.
 Food -and sometimes even water-had to be carried for both passengers and horses.
 Extra weight might have meant the difference between safety and disaster;
 baggage was charged for by the ounce;
 and yet Mark Twain carried with him a Webster's Unabridged Dictionary over mountain passes,
 across scorched deserts,
 and through a land infested with bandits and Indians.
 He wanted to make himself master of words,
 and with his characteristic cour-

 Telephone is made from two Greek words,

 Grocer comes from an old French word,
 grossier,
 and the French came from the Latin,
 grossarius,
 it literally means one who sells by the wholesale or gross.
 We got our word sugar from the French;
 the French borrowed it from the Spanish;
 the Spanish lifted it from the Arabic;
 the Arabic took it

 Your companion is one with whom you have bread.
 A company is really an association of people who are trying to make their bread together.
 Your salary literally means your salt money.
 The Roman soldiers drew a certain allowance for salt,
 and one day some wag spoke of his entire income as his salarium,
 and created a bit of slang which has long since become respectable English.
 You are holding in your hand a book.
 It literally means beech,
 for a long time ago the Anglo-Saxons scratched their words on beech trees and on tablets of beech wood.

The words janitor and January have both come down from the name of an Etruscan blacksmith who lived in Rome,
 and made a specialty of locks and bolts for doors.
 When he died,
 he was deified as a pagan god,
 and was represented as having two faces,
 so that he could look both ways at the same time,
 and was associated with the opening and closing of doors.
 So the month that stood at the close of one year and the opening of another was called January,
 or the month of Janus.
 So when we talk of January or a janitor,

In 1870 we went down the Tigris River.
 We hired a guide at Bagdad to show us Persepolis,
 Nineveh and Babylon,
 and the ancient countries of Assyria as far as the Arabian Gulf.
 He was well acquainted with the land,
 but he was one of those guides who love to entertain their patrons;
 he was like a barber that tells you many stories in order to keep your mind off the scratching and the scraping.
 He told me so many stories that I grew tired of his telling them and I refused to listen-looked away whenever he commenced;
 that made the guide quite angry.
 I remembered that toward evening he took his Turkish cap off his head and swung it around in the air.
 The gesture I did not understand and I did not look at him for fear I should become victim of another story.
 But,
 although I am not a woman,
 I did look,
 and the instant I turned my eyes upon that worthy guide he was off again.
 Said he,

He said there once lived not far from the River Indus an ancient Persian by the name of Al Hafed.
 He said that Al Hafed owned a very large farm with orchards,
 grain fields,
 and gardens.
 He was a contented and wealthy mancontented because he was wealthy,
 and wealthy because he was contented.
 One day there visited this old farmer one of those ancient Buddhist priests,
 and he sat down by Al Hafed's fire and told that old farmer how this world of
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 ours was made.
 He said that this world was once a mere bank of fog,
 which is scientifically true,
 and he said that the Almighty thrust his finger into the bank of fog and then began slowly to move his finger around and gradually to increase the speed of his finger until at last he whirled that bank of fog into a solid ball of fire,
 and it went rolling through the universe,
 burning its way through other cosmic banks of fog,
 until it condensed the moisture without,
 and fell in floods of rain upon the heated surface and cooled the outward crust.
 Then the internal flames burst through the cooling crust and threw up the mountains and made the hills and the valleys of this wonderful world of ours.
 If this internal melted mass turst out and cooled very quickly it became granite;
 that which cooled less quickly became silver;
 and less quickly,
 gold;
 and after gold diamonds were made.
 Said the old priest,

\begin_layout Standard
This is a scientific truth also.
 You all know that a diamond is pure carbon,
 actually deposited sunlight-and he said another thing I would not forget:
 he declared that a diamond is the last and highest of God's mineral creations,
 as a woman is the last and highest of God's animal creations.
 I suppose that is the reason why the two have such a liking for each other.
 And the old priest told Al Hafed that if he had a handful of diamonds he could purchase a whole country,
 and with a mine of diamonds he could place his children upon thrones through the influence of their great wealth.
 Al Hafed heard all about diamonds and how much they were worth,
 and went to his bed that night a poor man-not that he had lost anything,
 but poor because he was discontented and discontented because be thought he was poor.
 He said:

 So he sold his farm,
 collected his money at interest,
 left his family in charge of a neighbor,
 and away he went in search of diamonds.
 He began very properly,
 to my mind,
 at the Mountains of the Moon.
 Afterwards he went around into Palestine,
 then wandered on into Europe,
 and at last when his money was all spent,
 and he was in rags,
 wretchedness,
 and poverty,
 he stood on the shore of that bay in Barcelona.
 Spain,
 when a tidal wave came rolling through the Pillars of Hercules and the poor,
 afflicted,
 suffering man could not resist the awful temptation to cast himself into that incoming tide,
 and he sank beneath its foaming crest,

 Therę seemed to be no beginning,
 middle,
 or endnothing to it.
 That was the first story I had ever heard told or read in which the hero was killed in the first chapter.
 I had but one chapter of that story and the hero was dead.
 When the guide came back and took up the halter of my camel again,
 he went right on with the same story.
 He said that Al Hafed's successor led his camel out into the garden to drink,
 and as the camel put its nose down into the clear water of the garden brook Al Hafed's successor noticed a curious flash of light from the sands of the shallow stream,
 and reaching in he pulled out a black stone having an eye

 of light that reflected all the colors 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{i}$

 the rainbow,
 and he took that curious pebble into the house and left it on the mantel,
 then went on his way and forgot all about it.
 A few days after that,
 this same old priest who told 'Al Hafed how diamonds were made,
 came in to visit his successor.
 When he saw that flash of light from the maitel,

Then together they rushed to the garden and stirred up the white sands with their fingers and found other more beautiful,
 more valuable diamonds than the first,
 and thus,
 said the guide to me,
 were discovered the diamond mines of Golconda,
 the most magnificent diamond mines in all the history of mankind,
 exceeding the Kimberley in its value.
 The great Kohinoor diamond in England's crown jewels and the largest crown diamond on earth in Russia's crown jewels which I had often hoped she would have to sell before they had peace with Japan,
 came from that mine,
 and when the old guide had called my attention to that wonderful discovery he took his Turkish cap off his head again and swung it around in the air to call my attention to the moral.
 Those Arab guides have a moral to each story,
 though the stories are not afways moral.
 He said,

 starvation,
 poverty,
 and death in a strange land,

I told him his story reminded me of one,
 and I told it to him quick.
 I told him about that man out in California,
 who,
 in 1847,
 owned a ranch out there.
 He read that gold had been discovered in Southern California,
 and he sold his ranch to Colonel Sutter and started off to hunt for gold.
 Colonel Sutter put a mill on the little stream in that farm and one day his little girl brought some wet sand from the raceway of the mill into the house and placed it before the fire to dry,
 and as that sand was falling through the little girl's fingers a visitor saw the first shining scales of real gold that were ever discovered in California;
 and the man who wanted the gold had sold this ranch and gone away,
 never to return.
 I delivered this lecture two years ago in California,
 in the city that stands near that farm,
 and they told me that the mine is not exhausted yet,
 and that a one-third owner of that farm has been getting during these recent years twenty dollars of gold every fifteen minutes of his life,
 sleeping or waking.
 Why,
 you and I would enjoy an income like that.

\begin_layout Standard
But the best illustration that I have now of this thought was found in Pennsylvania.
 There was a man living in Pennsylvania who owned a farm there,
 and he did what I should do if I had a farm in Pennsylvania-he sold it.
 But before he sold it he concluded to secure employment collecting coal oil for his cousin in Canada.
 They first discovered coal oil there.
 So this farmer in Pennsylvania decided that he would apply for a position with his cousin in Canada.
 Now,
 you see,
 this farmer was not altogether a foolish man.
 He did not leave his farm until he had something else to do.
 Of all the simpletons the stars shine on there is none more foolish than a man who leaves one job before he has obtained
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 another.
 And that has especial refefence to gentlemen of my profession,
 and has not reference to a man seeking a divorce.
 So I say this old farmer did not leave one job until he had obtained another.
 He wrote to Canada,
 but his cousin replied that he could not engage him because he did not know anything about the oil business.

 So he set himself at the study of the whole subject.
 He began at the second day of the creation,

 until he knew all about it.
 Then he wrote to his cousin and said,

 He had scarcely gone from that farm before the man who purchased it went out to arrange for watering the cattle and he found that the previous owner had arranged the matter very nicely.
 There is a stream running down the hillside there,
 and the previous owner had gone out and put a plank across that stream at an angle,
 extending across the brook and down edgewise a few inches under the surface of the water.
 The purpose of the plank across that brook was to throw over to the other bank a dreadfullooking scum through which the cattle would not put their noses to drink above the plank,
 although they would drink the water on one side below it.
 Thus that man who had gone to Canada had been himself damming back for twentythree years a flow of coal oil which the State Geologist of Pennsylvania declared officially,
 as early as 1870,
 was then worth to our State,
 a hundred millions of dollars.
 The city of Titusville now stands on that farm and those Pleasantville wells flow on,
 and that farmer who had studied all about the formation of oil since the second day of God's creation clear down to the present time,
 sold that farm for

But as he was the only son he had his way-they always do;
 and they sold out in Massachusetts and went to Wisconsin,
 where he went into the employ of the Superior Copper Mining Company,
 and he was lost from sight in the employ of that company at fifteen dollars a week again.
 He was also to have an interest in any mines that he should discover for that company.
 But I do not believe that he has ever discovered a mine-I do not know anything about it,
 but I do not believe he has.
 I know he had scarcely gone from the old hom 3 stead before the farmer who had bought the homestead went out to dig potatoes,
 and as he was bringing them in in a large basket through the front gateway,
 the ends of the stone wall came so near together at the gate that the basket hugged very tight.
 So he set the basket on the ground and pulled,
 first at one side and then on the other side.
 Our farms in Massachusetts are mostly stone walls,
 and the farmers have to be economical with their gateways in order to have some place to put the stones.
 That basket hugged so tight there that as he was hauling it through he noticed in the upper stone next the

 eight indnes square;
 and this professer of mines and mining and mineralogy,

 And yet this religious prejudice is so great that some people think it is a great honor to be one of God's poor.
 I am looking in the faces of people who think just that way.
 I heard a man once say in a prayer meeting that he was thankful that he was one of God's poor,
 and then I silently wondered what his wife would say to that speech,
 as she took in washing to support the man while he sat and smoked on the veranda.
 I don't want to see any more of that kind of God's poor.
 Now,
 when a man could have been rich just as well,
 and he is now weak because he is poor,
 he has done some great wrong;
 he has been untruthful io himself;
 he has been unkind to his fellowmen.
 We ought to get rich if we can by honorable and Christian methods,
 and these are the only methods that sweep us quickly toward the goal of riches.

 He carried a gold-headed cane under his arm-more in its head than he had in his.
 I do not believe I could describe the young man if I should try.
 But still I must say that he wore an eye-glass he could not see through;
 patent leather shoes he could not walk in,
 and pants he could not sit down in-dressed like a grasshopper!
 Well,
 this human cricket came up to the clerk's desk just as I came in.

 The statistics very carefully gathered in New York in 1889 showed one hundred and seven millionaires in the city worth ovef ten millions apiece.
 It was remarkable and people think they must go there to get rich.
 Out of that one hundred and seven millionaires only seven of them made their money in New York,
 and the others moved to New York after their fortunes were made,
 and sixty-seven out of the remaining hundred made their fortunes in towns of less than six thousand people,
 and the richest man in the country at that time lived in a town of thirty-five hundred inhabitants,
 and always lived there and never moved away.
 It is not so much where you are as what you are.
 But at the same time if the largeness of the city
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 comes into the problem,
 then remember it is the smaller city that furnishes the great opportunity to make the millions of money.
 The best illustration that I can give is in reference to Joiln Jacob Astor,
 who was a poor boy and who made all the money of the Astor family.
 He made more than his successors have ever earned,
 and yet he once held a mortgage on a millinery store in New York,
 and because the people could not make enough money to pay the interest and the rent,
 he foreclosed the mortgage and took possession of the store and went into partnership with the man who had failed.
 He kept the same stock,
 did not give him a dollar capital,
 and he left him alone and went out and sat down upon a bench in the wark.
 Out there on that bench in the park he had the most important,
 and to my mind,
 the pleasantest part of that partnership business.
 He was watching the ladies as they went by;
 and where is the man that wouldn't get rich at that business?
 But when John Jacob Astor saw a lady pass,
 with her shoulders back and her head up,
 as if she did not care if the whole world looked on her,
 he studied her bonnet;
 and before that bonnet was out of sight he knew the shape of the frame and the color of the trimmings,
 the curl of the-something on a bonnet.
 Sometimes I try to describe a woman's bonnet,
 but it is of little use,
 for it would be out of style tomorrow night.
 So John Jacob Astor went to the store and said:
 
\begin_inset ERT

In our city especially there are great opportunities for manufacturing,
 and the time has come when the line is drawn very sharply between the stockholders of the factory and their employes.
 Now,
 friends,
 there has also come a discouraging gloom upon this country and the laboring men are beginning to feel that they are being held down by a crust over their heads through which they find it impossible to break,
 and the aristocratic money-owner himself is so far above that he will never descend to their assistance.
 That is the thought that is in the minds of our people.
 But,
 friends,
 never in the history of our country was there an opportunity so great for the poor man to get rich as there is now in the city of Philadelphia.
 The very fact that they get discouraged is what prevents them from getting rich.
 That is all there is to it.
 The road is open,
 and let us keep it open between the poor and the rich.
 I know that the labor unions have two great problems to contend with,
 and there is only one way to solve them.
 The labor unions are doing as much to prevent its solving as are the capitalists today,
 and there are positively two sides to it.
 The labor union has two difficulties;
 the first one is that it began to make a labor scale for all classes on a par,
 and they scale down a man that can earn five dollars a day to two and a half a day,
 in order to level up to him an imbecile that cannot earn fifty cents a day.
 That is one of the most dangerous and discouraging things for the working man.
 He cannot get the results of his work if he do better work or higher work or work longer;
 that is a dangerous thing,
 and in order to get every laboring man free and every American equal to every other American,
 let the laboring man ask what he is worth and get it-not let any capitalist say to him:
 
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

"
\end_layout

\end_inset

You shall work for me for half of what you are worth;
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 nor let any labor organization say 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

You shall work for the capitalist for half your worth.
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

"
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Be a man,
 be
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 independent,
 and then shall the laboring man find the road ever open from poverty to wealth.
 The other difficulty that the labor union has to consider,
 and this problem they have to solve themselves,
 is the kind of orators who come and talk to them about the oppressive rich.
 I can in my dreams recite the oration I have heard again and again under such circumstances.
 My life has been with the laboring man.
 I am a laboring man myself.
 I have often in their assemblies,
 heard the speech of the man who has been invited to address the labor union.
 The man who gets up before the assembled company of honest laboring men and he begins by saying:
 
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

"
\end_layout

\end_inset

Oh,
 ye honest,
 industrious laboring men,
 who have furnished all the capital of the world,
 who have built all the palaces and constructed all the railroads and covered the ocean with her steamships.
 Oh,
 you laboring men!
 You are nothing but slaves;
 you are ground down in the dust by the capitalist who is gloating over you as he enjoys his beautiful estates and as he has his banks filled with gold,
 and every dollar he owns is coined out of the heart's blood of the honest laboring man.
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\end_inset

 Now,
 that is a lie,
 and you know it is a lie;
 and yet that is the kind of speech that they are all the time hearing,
 representing the capitalists as wicked and the laboring men so enslaved.
 Why,
 how wrong it is!
 Let the man who loves his flag and believes in American principles endeavor with alh his soul to bring the capitalist and the laboring man together until they stand side by side,
 and arm in arm,
 and work for the common good of humanity.

 But the probability 
\begin_inset Formula $^{\text{c }}$
\end_inset

 is that the greatest inventor to benefit the world with his discovery is some person,
 perhaps some lady,
 who thinks she could not invent anything.
 Did you ever study the history of invention and see how strange it was that the man who made the greatest discovery did it without any previous idea that he was an inventor?
 Who are the great inventors?
 They are persons with plain,
 straightforward common sense,
 who saw a need in the world and immediately applied themselves to study that need.
 If you want to invent anything,
 don't try to find it in the wheels in your head nor in the wheels in your machine,
 but first find out what the people need,
 and then apply yourself to that need,
 and this leads to invention on the part of the people you would not dream of before.
 The great inventors are simply great men;
 the greater the man the more simple the man,
 and the more simple a machine,
 the more valuable it is.
 Did you ever know a really great man?
 His ways are so simple,
 so common,
 so plain,
 that you think any one could do what he is doing.
 So it is with the great men the world over.

I remember well a man up in my native hills,
 a poor man,
 who for twenty years was helped by the town in his poverty,
 who owned a wide-spreading maple tree that covered the pow man's cottage like a benediction from on high.
 I remember that tree,
 for in the spring-there were some

 roguish boys around that neighborhood when I was youngin the spring of the year the man would put a bucket there and the spouts to catch the maple sap,

 oh,
 so mean,
 that they went to that tree before that man had gotten out of bed in the morning,
 and after he had gone to bed at night,
 and drank up that sweet sap.
 I could swear they did it.
 He didn't make a great deal of maple sugar from that tree.
 But one day he made the sugar so white and crystalline that the visitor did not believe it was maple sugar;
 thought maple sugar must be red or black.

 And many of us are right by the tree that has a fortune for us,

 They found that a trout lays thirty-six hundred eggs every year and every trout gains a quarter of a pound every year,
 so that in four years a little trout will furnish four tons per annum to sell to the market at fifty cents a pound.
 When they found that,
 they said they

I would like to meet the great men who are here tonight.
 The great men!
 We don't have any great men in Philadelphia.
 Great men!
 You say that they all come from London,
 or San Francisco,
 or Rome,
 or Manayunk,
 or anywhere else but here-anywhere else but Philadelphia-and yet,
 in fact,
 there are just as great men in Philadelphia as in any sity of its size.
 There are great men and women in this audience.
 Great men,
 I have said,
 are very simple men.
 Just as many great men here as are to be found anywhere.
 The greatest error in judging great men is that we think that they always hold an office.
 The world knows nothing of its greatest men.
 Who are the great men of the world?
 The young man and young woman may well ask the question.
 It is not necessary that they should hold an office,
 and yet that is the popular idea.
 That is the idea we teach now in our high schools and common schools,
 that the great men are those who hold some high office,
 and unless we change that very soon and do away with that prejudice,
 we are going to change to an empire.
 There is no question about it.
 We must teach that men are great only on their intrinsic value,
 and not on the position that they may incidentally happen to occupy.
 And yet,
 don't blame the young men saying that they are going to be great when they get into some official position.
 I ask this audience again,
 who of you are going to be great?

 Won't you learn the lesson,

 that it is prima facie evidence of littleness to hold public office under our form of government?
 Think of it.
 This is a government of the people,
 and by the people,
 and for the people,
 and not for the office-holder,
 and if the people in this country rule as they always should rule,
 an office-holder is only
\begin_inset Newline newline

 the servant of the people,
 and the,

 In this country the people are the masters,

 Young man,
 remember that you never heard of a great man holding any political office in this country unless he took that office at the expense of himself.
 It is a loss to every great man to take a public office in our country.
 Bear this in mind,
 young man,
 that you cannot be made great by a political election.

I remember we had a Peace Jubilee here in Philadelphia soon after the Spanish war.
 Perhaps some of these visitors think we should not have had it until now in Philadelphia,

 The other seven men,

 were continually exposed to the Spanish fire,
 while Hobson,
 as an officer,
 might reasonably be behind the smokestack.
 Why,
 my friends,
 in this intelligent audience gathered here tonight I do not believe I could find a single person that can name the other seven men who were with Hobson.
 Why do we teach history in that way?
 We ought to teach that however humble the station a man may occupy,
 if he does his full duty in his place,
 he is just as much entitled to the American people's honor as is a king upon a throne.

I remember an incident that will illustrate this,
 the only one that I can give tonight.
 I am ashamed of it,
 but I don't dare leave it out.
 I close my eyes now;
 I look back through the years to 1863;
 I can see my native town in the Berkshire Hills,
 I can see that cattle-show ground filled with people;
 I can see that church there and the town hall crowaed,
 and hear bands playing,
 and see flags flying and handkerchiefs streaming-well do I recall at this moment
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 that day.
 The people had turned out to receive a company of soldiers,
 and that company came marching up on the Common.
 They had served out one term in the Civil War and had re-enlisted,
 and they were being received by their native townsmen.
 I was but a boy,
 but I was captain of that company,
 puffed out with pride on that day-why,
 a cambric needle would have burst me all to pieces.
 As I marched on the Common at the head of my company,
 there was not a man more proud than I.
 We marched into the town hall and then they seated my soldiers down in the center of the house and I took my place.
 down on the front seat,
 and then the town officers filed through the great throng of people,
 who stood close and packed in that little hall.
 They came up on the platform,
 formed a half circle around it,
 and the mayor of the town,
 the 
\begin_inset ERT

chairman of the Selectmen
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\end_inset

 in New England,
 took his seat in the middle of that half circle.
 He was an old man,
 his hair -was gray;
 he never held an office before in his life.
 He thought that an office was all he needed to be a truly great man,
 and when he came up he adjusted his powerful spectacles and glanced calmly around the audience with amazing dignity.
 Suddenly his eyes fell upon me,
 and then the good old man came right forward and invited me to come up on the stand with the town officers.
 Invited me up on the stand!
 No town officer ever took notice of me before I went to war.
 Now,
 I should not say that.
 One town officer was there who advised the teacher to

 So I was invited up on the stand with the town officers.
 I took my seat and let my sword fall on the floor,
 and folded my arms across my breast and waited to be received.
 Napoleon the Fifth!
 Pride goeth before destruction and a fall.
 When I had gotten my seat and all became silent through the hall,
 the chairman of the Selectmen arose and came forward with great dignity to the table,
 and we all supposed he would introduce the Congregational minister,
 who was the only orator in the town,
 and who would
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 give the oration to the returning soldiers.
 But,
 friends,
 you should have seen the surprise that ran over that audience when they discovered that this old farmer was going to deliver that oration himself.
 He had never made a speech in his life before,
 but he fell into the same error that others have fallen into,
 he seemed to think that the office would make him an orator.
 So he had written out a speech and walked up and down the pasture until he had learned it by heart and frightened the cattle,
 and he brought that manusript with him,
 and taking it from his pocket,
 he spread it carefully 
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

upon the table.
 Then he adjusted his spectacles to be sure that he might see it,
 and walked far back on the platform and then stepped forward like this.
 He must have studied the subject much,
 for he assumed an elocutionary attitude;
 he rested heavily upon his left heel,
 slightly advanced the right foot,
 threw back his shoulders,
 opened the organs of speech,
 and advanced his right hand at an angle of forty-five degrees.
 As he stood in that elocutionary attitude this is just the way that speech went,
 this is it precisely.
 Some of my friends have asked me if I do not exaggerate it,
 but I could not exaggerate it.
 Impossible!
 This is the way it went;
 although I am not here for the story but the lesson that is back of it:

 Not because he is any the less brave,

 Greatness consists not in holding some office;
 greatness really consists in doing some great deed with little means,

 that is true greatness.

 better homes,
 better schools,

 Man is a growth by law,
 and not a creation by artifice,
 and cause and effect is as absolute and undeviating in the hidden realm of thought as in the world of visible and material things.
 A noble and God-like character is not a thing of favor or chance,
 but is the natural result of continuous effort
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 and right thinking,
 the effect of long-therished association with God-like thought.
 An ignoble and bestial character,
 by the same process,
 is the result of the continued harboring of grovelling thoughts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Man is made or unmade by himself;
 in the armory of thought he forges the weapons by which he destroys himself;
 he also fashions the tools with which he builds for himself heavenly mansions of joy and strength and peace.
 By the right choice and true application of thought,
 man ascends to the Divine Perfection;
 by the abuse and wrong application of thought,
 he descends below the level of the beast.
 Between these two extremes are all the grades of character,
 and man is their maker and maseer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of all the beautiful truths pertaining to the soul which have been restored and brought to light in this age,
 none is more gladdening or fruitful of divine promise and confidence than this-that man is the master of thought,
 the moulder of character,
 and the maker and shaper of condition,
 environment,
 and destiny.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a being of Power,
 Intelligence,

 When he begins to reflect upon his condition,
 and to search diligently for the Law upon which his being is established,
 he then becomes the wise master,
 directing his energies with intelligence,

 and man can only thus become by discovering within himself the laws of thought;
 which discovery is totally a matter of application,
 self-analysis,
 and experience.

 tracing their effects upon himself,

EFFECT OF THOUGHT ON CIRCUMSTANCES
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A man's mind may be likened to a garden,
 which may be intelligently cultivated or allowed to run wild;
 but whether cultivated or neglected,
 it must,
 and will,
 bring forth.
 If no useful seeds are put into it,
 then an abundance of useless weed-seeds will fall therein,
 and will continue to produce their kind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just as the gardener cultivates his plot,
 keeping it free from weeds,
 and growing the flowers and fruits which he requires,
 so may a man tend the garden of his mind,
 weeding out all the wrong,
 useless,
 and impure thoughts,
 and cultivating toward perfection the flowers and fruits of right,
 useful,
 and pure thoughts.
 By pursuing this process,
 a man sooner or later discovers that he is the master-gardener of his soul,
 the director of his life.
 He also reveals,
 within himself,
 the laws of thought,
 and understands,
 with ever increasing accuracy,
 how the thought-forces and mind elements operate in the shaping of his character,
 circumstances,
 and destiny.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thought and character are one,
 and as character can
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 only manifest and discover itself through environment and circumstance,
 the outer conditions of a person's life will always be found to be harmoniously related to his inner state.
 This does not mean that a man's circumstances at any given time are an indication of his entire character,
 but that those circumstances are so intimately connected with some vital thought-element within himself that,
 for the time being,
 they are indispensable to his development.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every man is where he is by law of his being;
 the thoughts which he has built into his character have broughe him there,
 and in the arrangement of his life there is no element of chance,
 but all is the result of a law which cannot err.
 This is just as true of those who feel

As a progressive and evolving being,
 man is where he is that he may learn that he may grow;
 and as he learns the spiritual lesson which any circumstance contains for him,
 it passes away and gives place to other circumstances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Man is buffeted by circumstances so long as he believes himself to be the creature of outside conditions,
 but when he realizes that he is a creative power,
 and that he may command the hidden soil and seeds of his being out of which circumstances grow,
 he then becomes the rightful master of himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That circumstances grow out of thought every man knows who has for any length of time practiced self-control and selfpurification,
 for he will have noticed that the alteration in his circumstances has been in exact ratio with his altered mental condition.
 So true is this that when a man earnestly applies himself to remedy the defects in his character,
 and makes swift and marked progress,
 he passes rapidly through a succession of vicissitudes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The soul attracts that which it secretly harbors;
 that which it loves,
 and also that which it fears;
 it reaches the height of its cherished aspirations;
 it falls to the level of its unchastened d esiges,-and circumstances are the means by which the soul receives its own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every thought-seed sown or allowed to fall into the mind,
 and to take root there,
 produces its own,
 blossoming sooner orlater into act,

 Good thoughts bear good fruit,
 bad thoughts bad fruit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The outer world of circumstance shapes itself to the inner world of thought,
 and both pleasant and unpleasant external conditions are factors which make for the ultimate good of the individual.
 As' the reaper of his own harvest,
 man learns both by suffering and bliss.

\begin_layout Standard
Following the inmost desires,
 aspirations,
 thoughts,
 by which he allows himself to be dominated (pursuing the will-o'-the-wisps of impure imaginings or steadfastly walking the highway of strong and high endeavor),
 a man at last arrives at their fruition and fulfilment in the outer conditions of his life.
 The laws of growth and adjustment everywhere obtain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A man does not come to the pothouse or the gaol by the tyranny of fate or circumstance,
 but by the pathway of grovelling thoughts and base desires.
 Nor does a pureminded man fall suddenly into crime by stress of any mere external force;
 the criminal thought had long been secretly fostered in the heart,
 and the hour of opportunity revealed its gathered power.
 Circumstance does not make the man;
 it reveals him to himself.
 No such conditions can exist as descending into vice and its attendant sufferings apart from vicious inclinations,
 or ascending into virtue and its pure happiness without the continued cultivation of virtuous aspirations;
 and man,
 therefore,
 as the lord and master of thought,
 is the maker of himself,
 the shaper and author of environment.
 Even at birth the soul comes to its own,
 and through every step of its earthly pilgrimage it attracts those combinations of conditions which reveal itself,
 which are the
\begin_inset Newline newline

 reflections of its own purity and impurity,
 its strength and weakness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Men do not attract that which they want,
 but that which they are.
 Their whims,
 fancies,

 It means that a man is continually revolting against an effect without,
 while all the time he is nourishing and preserving its cause in his heart.
 That cause may take the form of a conscious vice or an unconscious weakness;
 but whatever it is,
 it stubbornly retards the efforts of its possessor,
 and thus calls aloud for remedy.

Men are anxious to improve their circumstances,
 but are unwilling to improve themselves;
 they therefore remain bound.
 The man who does not shrink from self-crucifixion can never fail to accomplish the object upon which his heart is set.
 This is true of earthly as of heavenly things.
 Even the man whose sole object is to acquire wealth must be prepared to make great personal sacrifices before he can accomplish his object;
 and how much more so he who would realize a strong and well-poised life?

 Such a mary does not under-

 stand the simplest sudiments of these principles which are the basis of true prosperity,
 and is not only totally unfitted to rise out of his wretchedness,

 indolent,
 deceptive and unmanly thoughts.

Here is a rich man who is the victim of a painful and persistent disease as a result of gluttony.
 He is willing to give large sums of money to get rid of it,

 Such a man is totally unfit to have health,

Here is an employer of labor who adopts crooked measures to avoid paying the regulation wage,

 he blames circumstances,
 not knowing that he is the sole author of his condition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have introduced these three cases merely as illustrative of the truth that man is the causer (though nearly always unconsciously) of his circumstances,
 and that,
 whilst aiming at a good end,
 he is continually frustrating its accomplishment by encouraging thoughts and desires which cannot possibly harmonize with that end.
 Such cases could be multiplied and varied almost indefinitely,
 but this is not necessary,
 as the reader can,
 if he so resolves,
 trace the action of the laws of thought in his own mind and life,
 and until this is done,
 mere external facts cannot serve as a ground of reasoning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Circumstances,
 however,
 are so complicated,
 thought is so deeply rooted,
 and the conditions of happiness vary so vastly with individuals,
 that a man's entire soul-condition (although it may be known to himself) cannot be judged by another from the external aspects of his life alone.
 A man may be honest in certain directions,
 yet suffer privations;
 a man may
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 be dishonest in certain directions,
 yet acquire wealth;
 but the conclusion usually formed that the one man fails because of his particular honesty,
 and that the other prospers because of his particular dishonesty,
 is the result of a superficial judgment,
 which assumes that the dishonest man is almost totally corrupt,
 and the honest man almost entirely virtuous.
 In the light of a deeper knowledge and wider experience,
 such judgment is found to be erroneous.
 The dishonest man may have some admirable virtues which the other does not possess;
 and the honest man obnoxious vices which are absent in the other.
 The honest man reaps the good results of his honest thoughts and acts;
 he also brings upon himself the sufterings which his vices produce The dishonest man likewise garners his own suffering and happiness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is pleasing to human vanity to believe that one suffers because of one's virtues;
 but not until a man has extirpated every sickly,
 bitter,
 and impure thought from his mind,
 and washed every sinful stain from his soul,
 can he be in a position to know and declare that his sufferings are the result of his good,
 and not of his bad qualities;
 and on the way to,
 yet long before he has reached that supreme perfection he will have found,
 working in his mind and life,
 the Great Law which is absolutely just,
 and which cannot,
 therefore,
 give good for evil,
 evil for good.
 Possessed of such knowledge,
 he will then know,
 looking back upon his past ignorance and blindness,
 that his life is,
 and always was,
 justly ordered,
 and that all his past experiences,
 good and bad,
 were the equitable outworking of his evolving,
 yet unevolved self.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Good thoughts and actions can never produce bad results;
 bad thoughts and actions can never produce good results.
 This is but saying that nothing can come from corn but corn,
 nothing from nettles but nettles.
 Men understand this law in the natural world,
 and work with it;
 but few understand it in the mental and moral world (though its operation there is just as simple and undeviating,
 and they,
 therefore,
 do not co-operate with it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suffering is always the effect of wrong thought in some direction.
 It is an indication that the individual is out of harmony with himself,
 with the Law of his being.
 The sole and sapreme use of suffering is to purify,
 to burn out all that is useless and impure.
 Suffering ceases for him who is pure.
 There could be no object in burning gold after the dross had been removed,
 and a perfectly pure and enlightened being could not suffer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The circumstances which a man encounters with suffering are the result of his own mental inharmony.
 The circumstances which a than encounters with blessedness are the result of his own mental harmony.
 Blessedness,
 not material possessions,
 is the measure of right thought;
 wretchedness,

Indigence and indulgence are the two extremes of wretchedness.

A man only begins to be a man when he ceases to whine and revile,

 And as he adapts his mind to that regulating factor,
 he ceases to accuse others as the cause of his condition,

 ceases to kick against circumstances,
 but begins to use them as aids to his more rapid progress,
 and as a means of discovering the hidden powers and possibilities within himself.

 Men imagine that thought can be kept secret,
 but it cannot;
 it rapidly crystallizes into habit,
 and habit solidifies into circumstance.
 Bestial thoughts crystallize into habits of drunkenness and sensuality,
 which solidify into circumstances of destitution and disease;
 impure thoughts of every kind crystallize into enervating and confusing habits,
 which solidify into distracting and adverse circumstances;
 thoughts of fear,
 doubt,

 indigence,

 lazy thoughts crystallize into habits of uncleanliness and dishonesty,

 hateful and condemnatory thoughts crystallize into habits of accusation and violence,
 which solidify into circumstances of injury afid persecution;
 selfish thoughts of all kinds crystallize into habits of selfseeking,
 which solidify into circumstances more or less distressing.
 On the other hand,
 beautiful thoughts of all kinds crystallize into habits of grace and kindliness,
 which solidify into genial and sunny circumstances;
 pure thoughts crystallize into habits of temperance and self-control,
 which solidify into circumstances of repose and peace;
 thoughts of courage,
 self-reliance,

EFFECT OF THOUGHT ON HEALTH AND BODY

The body is the servant of the mind.

Disease and health,

 Sickly thoughts will express themselves through a sickly body.
 Thoughts of fear have been known to kill a man as speedily as a bullet,

 The people who live in fear of disease are the people who get it.
 Anxiety quickly demoralizes the whole body,

 while impure thoughts,
 even if not physically indulged,
 will soon shatter the nervous system.

\begin_layout Standard
A man should conceive of a legitimate purpose in his heart,
 and set out to accomplish it.
 He should make this purpose the centralizing point of his thoughts.
 It may take the form of a spiritual ideal,
 or it may be a worldly object,
 according to his nature at the time being;
 but whichever it is,
 he should steadily focus his thought forces upon the object which he has set before him.
 He should make this purpose his supreme duty,
 and should devote himself to its attainment,
 not allowing his thoughts to wander away into ephemeral fancies,
 longings,
 and imaginings.
 This is the royal road to self-control and true concentration of thought.
 Even if he fails again and again to accomplish his purpose (as he necessarily must until weakness is overcome),
 the strength of character gained will be the measure of his true success,
 and this will form a new starting-point for future power and triumph.

Having conceived of his purpose,
 a man should mentally make out a straight pathway to its achievement,

 Doubts and fears should be rigorously excluded;
 they are disintegrating elements which break up the straight line of effort,

 ineffectual,
 useless.
 Thoughts of doubt and fear never accomplish anything,

 They always lead to failure.
 Purpose,

THE THOUGHT FACTOR IN ACHIEVEMENT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts.
 In a justly ordered universe,
 where loss of equipoise would mean total destruction,
 individual responsibility must be absolute.
 A man's weakness and strength,
 purity and impurity,
 are his own,
 and not another man's;
 they are brought about by himself,
 and not by another;
 and they can only be altered by himself,
 never by another.
 His condition is also his own,
 and not another man's.
 His suffering and his happiness are evolved from within.
 As he thinks,
 so he is;
 as he continues to think,
 so he remains.
 A strong man cannot help a weaker unless that weaker is willing to be helped,
 and even then the weak man must become strong of himself;
 he must,
 by his own efforts,
 develop the strength which he admires in another.
 None but himself can alter his condition.

 He conceives of,

 unrest urges him to action,

 Very soon so altered has his mind become that the workshop can no longer hold him.
 It has become so out of harmony with his mentality that it falls out of his life as a garment is cast aside,

SERENITY
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Calmness of mind is one of the beautiful jewels of wisdom.
 It is the result of long and patient effort in selfcontrol.
 Its presence is an indication of ripened experience,
 and of a more than ordinary knowledge of the laws and operations of thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A man becomes calm in the measure that he understands himself as a thought-evolved being,
 for such knowledge necessitates the understanding of others as the result of thought,
 and as he develops a right understanding,
 and sees more and more clearly the internal relations of things by the action of cause and effect,
 he ceases to fuss and fume and worry and grieve,
 and remains poised,
 steadfast,
 serene.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The calm man,
 having learned how to govern himself,
 knows how to adapt himself to others;
 and they,
 in turn,
 reverence his spiritual strength,
 and feel that they can learn of him and rely upon him.
 The more tranquil a man becomes,
 the greater is his success,
 his influence,
 his power for good.
 Even the ordinary trader will find his business prosperity increase as he develops a greater self-control and equanimity,
 for people will always prefer to deal with a man whose demeanor is strongly equable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The strong,
 calm man is always loved and revered.
 He is like a shade-giving tree in a thirsty land,
 or a sheltering rock in a storm.

Who does not love a tranquil heart,
 a sweettempered,
 balanced life?
 It does not matter whether it rains or shines,
 or what changes come to those possessing these blessings,
 for they are always sweet,
 serene,
 and calm.
 That exquisite poise of character which we call serenity is the last lesson of culture;
 it is the flowering of life,
 the fruitage of the soul.
 It is precious as wisdom.
 More to be desired than gold-yea,
 than even fine gold.
 How insignificant mere

 money-seeking looks in comparison with a serene life-a life that dwells in the ocean of Truth,
 beneath the waves,
 beyond the reach of tempests,
 in the Eternal Calm.

How many people we know who sour their lives,
 who ruim all that is sweet and beautiful by explosive tempers,
 who destroy their poise of character,
 and make bad blood!
 It is a question whether the great majority of people do not ruin their lives and mar their happiness by lack of selfcontrol.
 How few people we meet in life who are well balance:
 who have that exquisite poise which is characteristic of the finished charaeter!

Yes,
 humanity surges with uncontrolled passion,
 is tumultuous with ungoverned grief,
 is blown about by anxiety and doubt.
 Only the wise man,
 only he whose thoughts are controlled and purified,
 makes the winds and the storms of the soul obey him.

Tempest-tossed souls,
 wherever ye may be,
 under whatsoever conditions ye may live,
 know this-in the ocean of life the isles of Blessedness are smiling,
 and the sunny shore of your ideal awaits your coming.
 Keep your hand firmly upon the helm of thought.
 In the barque of your soul reclines the commanding Master;
 He does but sleep:
 wake Him.
 Self-control is strength;
 Right Thought is mastery;
 Calmness is power.
 Say unto your heart,
